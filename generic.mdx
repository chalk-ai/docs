Chalk doesn't need to officially support a data source
or API vendor for you to include it in your feature pipelines.
Chalk has a mechanism for initializing objects at boot time,
and then you can use those objects within your resolver.

---

## Initializing

To initialize your custom data source, use the `@before_all`
decorator. The decorated function will run before any of your
resolvers are called:

```py
import os
from chalk.features import before_all

vendor_client: VendorClient = VendorClient(...)

@before_all
def initialize():
    key = os.getenv("MY_VENDOR_KEY")
    vendor_client.api_key = key
```

This function has access to all
[environment variables](/docs/env-vars)
configured for your environment.
Then, in your [resolver](/docs/resolver-overview),
you can use the `vendor_client`
knowing it has been correctly initialized.

```py
@online
def get_vendor_score(...) -> ...:
    vendor_client.do_something(...)
```

You can alternatively supply environment-specific
initialization functions. The `before_all` decorator
takes an optional keyword argument `environment` that
accepts a single environment name or a list of applicable
environment names:

```py
@before_all(environment="**production**")
def initialize():
    ...

@before_all(environment=["**staging**", "**development**"])
def initialize():
    ...
```

### Initialization order

The order in which setup hooks run is not guaranteed and may differ across instances of your service. Your setup hooks
should not rely on being called in a specific order.

### Scopes

You should be careful when trying to assign a variable outside the local
scope. In the below example, the vendor_client isn't initialized as it may
appear to be. Instead, a new local variable that shadows the name in the
outer scope is initialized, and the outer variable doesn't receive a value.

<TipBad>Careful with assigning outside of the local scope.</TipBad>

```py
vendor_client: VendorClient

@before_all
def initialize():
    vendor_client = VendorClient(...)
```

Instead, try modifying the client inside the initialization function:

<TipGood>Modify the outer scope from the inner scope.</TipGood>

```py
vendor_client: VendorClient = VendorClient(...)

@before_all
def initialize():
    vendor_client.api_key = os.getenv("MY_VENDOR_KEY")
```

If you really want to assign a variable in the outer scope, you can
use Python's `global` keyword.

<TipGood>Use the global to modify outside of local scope (not recommended, but correct)</TipGood>

```py
vendor_client: VendorClient

@before_all
def initialize():
    global vendor_client
    vendor_client = VendorClient(...)
```

However, if you do this,
you need to make sure that access to `vendor_client`
happens through the module.
[Global is discouraged](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#25-global-variables)
because of this footgun.

```py
import myproject
from myproject import vendor_client

@online
def fn(...) -> ...:
    vendor_client.api_call(...)            # Error! vendor_client is None
    myproject.vendor_client.api_call(...)  # Correct!
```

---

## Cleaning up

If there is clean up work you need to do when Chalk
suspends your runtime, you can specify that work in
a function decorated with `@after_all`.

```py
from chalk.features import after_all

@after_all
def tear_down():
    ...
```

As with [before_all](/docs/generic#initializing), you can
optionally supply a filter on the environment:

```py
@after_all(environment=["**production**"])
def tear_down():
    ...

@after_all(environment=["**staging**"])
def tear_down():
    ...
```
