## Installation

### Dependencies

Install Chalk in your notebook environment by running the following command in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
!pip install chalkpy[all]
```

### Authentication

To use Chalk in a notebook, we will need to generate a client ID and secret key pair.

In the Chalk Dashboard, under **Settings > Access Tokens**,
generate a client ID and secret key pair by clicking on **New Token** and selecting all necessary permissions.

We will need the client ID and client secret we generated to initialize
a Chalk client in our notebook.

---

## Environment Setup

You can use the `ChalkClient` from any Jupyter notebook environment.

### Local

If you are working with a local notebook, Chalk will pick up your credentials
generated from running `chalkpy login` in your terminal.

All you need to do is initialize the client:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

### Deepnote

On Deepnote, you can set [environment variables](https://deepnote.com/docs/environment-variables) by going to the
integrations tab and clicking on the "Environment Variables" button.

![Deepnote Environment Variables](/img/DeepnoteEnvVar.png)

Set the `CHALK_CLIENT_ID` and `CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET` variables to the values you generated in the previous step.
You can then initialize Chalk by running the following code in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
import os
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

### Hex

On [Hex](https://hex.tech), you can store the client ID and secret key using [secrets](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/environment-configuration/environment-views#secrets)

![Hex Secrets](/img/HexSecrets.png)

Select `Python 3.10` as the image under **Environment > Compute Profile**.

![Hex Python Image](/img/HexPythonImage.png)

The Chalk client can then be initialized referencing the variables directly.

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient(
  client_id=CHALK_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret=CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET
)
```

## Creating a branch

To start using Chalk in a notebook, we will need to create a [branch deployment](/docs/branches).
Branch deployments are isolated environments that can be used to test features and resolvers before deploying them to production.

Working in a branch makes it seamless to iterate on features and resolvers in notebooks.
Any time we execute a cell in our notebook with feature or resolver definitions,
Chalk will automatically update our branch deployment with the latest changes.

Once you've got your client setup, you can create a branch calling [`create_branch`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.create_branch).
Setting `switch=True` will point your client to the newly created branch.

```python notebook.ipynb
client.create_branch("my-branch", switch=True)
```

## Cell Magics

Chalk provides a set of [IPython magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) to improve the experience of defining resolvers in notebooks.

### %%resolver

You can define a SQL resolver in a notebook cell using the `%%resolver` magic. The magic will parse the cell contents
and upload your resolver to your current working branch.

`%%resolver` needs to be followed by a resolver name, e.g. `root_authorization_resolver` as shown below.

Refer to the section on [SQL Resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers) to learn more about how to define resolvers.

```sql notebook.ipynb
%%resolver root_authorization_resolver
-- resolves: Authorization
-- source: snowflake
SELECT
    id,
    amount_in_cents,
    card_id,
    merchant_id,
    created_at as authorized_at
FROM authorizations
```

Chalk lines up the names of your target SQL columns with the names of your features.
In this case, we have an `Authorization` feature class that contains a features called `authorized_at`.
However, our Snowflake table has a column called `created_at` that we want to use to populate the `authorized_at` feature.
So, we use the `as` keyword to rename the column in our resolver.

## Inline Syntax


In notebooks, you can define features inline using the syntax shown below.

Consider the following feature class definition for `RocketEngine`

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.features import features

@features
class RocketEngine:
    id: int
    mass: float
    volume: float
    thrust: float
```

If we wanted to define a feature inline in a notebook cell, we could do so using the underscore syntax below:


```python notebook.ipynb
RocketEngine.density: float = _.mass / _.volume
```
