Chalk makes it really easy to write and test out new features from a notebook.

To get started, you'll want to install and connect Chalk to your notebook environment. Generally
this involves two steps:

- Installing the `chalkpy[runtime]` package,
- Authenticating to Chalk (using the `chalk` cli or by setting environment variables)

We provide specific setup instructions for [Deepnote](/docs/notebook-development#deepnote), [Hex](/docs/notebook-development#hex) and [Vertex](/docs/notebook-development#vertex-and-google-collab-enterprise), but the process should be similar for other notebook environments.

## Installing the Chalk Python Dependency

To install dependencies, run the `!pip install "chalkpy[runtime]"` bash command directly in a cell. Alternatively,
you can add and install the `chalkpy[runtime]` dependency in your kernel's virtual environment.

---

## Connecting Your Notebook to Chalk

To authenticate, we recommend generating a client ID and client secret pair.

To do this, open the Chalk Dashboard. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens** and click on **New Token**, selecting all necessary permissions (generally, you'll want: online query, offline query, and preview deployment permissions).

You can now use these access credentials to connect Chalk to any Jupyter notebook environment—we walk through
this process for a few different notebook environments in our [notebook setup docs](/docs/notebook-setup).

## Verifying the Setup

To verify that everything is properly set up, you can run the following code in a cell

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
client.whoami()
```

If everything is properly configured, you should see your `user_id`, `team_id` and `environment_id` come back.

## Loading Features

Now we can start building some new features!

To load your Chalk features into your notebook, you'll want to run:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()

client.load_features()
```

This will print out your available features and load them into your notebook:

```

└────────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

We'll use the data schema above for the rest of this tutorial.

Before we get started writing features, you'll want to import `_` from
Chalk `_` (underscore) allows you to build out features on your feature classes. If you want to create and work from a new branch, run the following command:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.features import _

client.get_or_create_branch(branch_name="<your-branch-name>")
```

This command will:
1. create a new Chalk branch deployment that has the same features defined as your main chalk deployment.
2. point your client to that new branch.

If the branch already exists, your client will just be updated to point to that branch.

## Building New Features

Lets say we want to write a new exclaimed name feature, which is a director's name with an exclamation mark tacked on.
To do this, run the following code in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
Director.exclaimed_name = _.name + "!"
```

In this example, the underscore acts as a reference to the `Director` feature class`.

We have now created a new feature in our notebook and can query for it in either an online or offline context.

## Querying for features

To query for your new features, pass them as outputs to the `ChalkClient` query methods. For instance, to run an
online query for your new `Director.exclaimed_name` feature, you can run the following:

```python notebook.ipynb
new_features = client.query(
    input={
        Director.id: 113,
    },
    output={
        Director.name,
        Director.name_exclaimed,
    }
)

new_features
```

Running an offline query is equally straight forward:

```python notebook.ipynb
chalk_dataset = client.offline_query(
    input={
        Director.id: list(range(1000)),
    },
    output={
        Director.id,
        Director.name,
        Director.name_exclaimed,
    },
    recompute_features=True,
    run_asynchronously=True,
    dataset_name="<dataset_name>",
)

df = chalk_dataset.to_pandas()
```

Running the offline query above creates a Pandas `DataFrame` with the columns `Director.id`, `Director.name`, and `Director.name_exclaimed` (alongside
some metadata columns). This `DataFrame` will have one row for your Directors with ids 0 to 999.

By providing a `dataset_name` to the offline_query, we've created a named dataset. Named datasets can easily be shared with other team members.

Any historical dataset can be accessed using the `ChalkClient`. Named datasets can be accessed as follows:

```python notebook.ipynb
client = ChalkClient()

client.get_dataset(name="<datset_name>")
```

## Building Out More Complex Features

You can use underscores to build out more complex features: generally these more complex features are composed of: has-one relationships, has-many relationships, and chalk functions.

### Using Has-one Relationships

In the schema we've defined above a Movie is in a has-one relationship with its Director (even if this is not necessarily true in practice).

When building new features on the Movie class, features from joined classes can be directly accessed. For instance, lets say we want to define `Movie.is_latest_release`.
We can accomplish this by defining a feature that reaches through the has_one join:

```python notebook.ipynb
Movie.is_latest_release= _.director.num_movies == _.release_number
```

The expression above defines a boolean feature which tests whether the release number for a movie (`_.release_number`) is equal to the number of movies a director
has released (`_.director.num_movies`).

### Using Has-many Relationships

In the schema we've defined above a Director is in a has-many relationship with their Movies.

When building new features on the Director class, features from joined classes can be directly accessed. For instance, lets say we want to define `Director.average_movie_runtime`. We can accomplish this by defining an aggregation feature:

```python notebook.ipynb
Director.average_movie_runtime = _.movies[_.runtime].mean()
```

In the above example, the two different `_`'s refer to two different feature class namespaces.

- `_.movies` can be thought of as `Director.movies`,
- `_.runtime` can be thought of as `Movie.runtime`.

The expression above gets a directors movies (`_.movies`), specifies that the aggregation is hapening on the
runtime field of those movies (`_.movies[_.runtime]`) and then calculates the mean.

Filters can also be passed to these expressions. For instance, say we want to filter out any movie
that has a primary or secondary genre of `short` from the average runtime. This can be done as follows:

```python notebook.ipynb
Director.average_movie_runtime_filtered = _.movies[
    _.runtime,                      # aggregation column
    _.primary_genre != "short",     # filter
    _.secondary_genre != "short"    # additional filter
].mean()
```

### Using Chalk Functions

Chalk exposes a number of functions that can be called and composed—a full list of them can be found on our [expressions page](/docs/expression#additional-functions).

_Identify whether a movie was released:_

```python notebook.ipynb
Movie.is_directors_usual_genre = F.contains(_.director.genres, _.primary_genre)
```

_Get whether a movie was released on a federal holiday:_

```python notebook.ipynb
Movie.released_on_holiday = F.is_us_federal_holiday(_.release_daate)
```

_Get release_date of Director's last movie:_

```python notebook.ipynb
Director.latest_movie_release = F.max_by(_.movies[_.release_date], _.release_date)
```

### Composing New Features

The features you've defined in your notebook can also be composed—they can be used to define new features.
For instance, you can define the `Director.makes_movies_that_are_too_long` feature:

```python notebook.ipynb
Director.makes_movies_that_are_too_long = _.average_movie_runtime > 150
```

## Translating this Code into Production Code

Defining features as these expressions provides a couple really significant advantages:

1. You build out really modular and granular features that can be composed.
2. Your features translate directly into performant code—everything we've written in this tutorial can be directly translated to your Chalk feature store and run efficiently.
