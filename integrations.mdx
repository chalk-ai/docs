## Integrate any API or Data Source

Instead of complex ETL jobs and streaming pipelines,
make direct calls to your data sources. Chalk makes
it fast and easy to call external APIs, query production
databases and data warehouses, or fetch parquet files
from S3. Chalk orchestrates pipeline stages automatically
to achieve maximum possible parallelism, and makes it
easy to pre-compute + cache features when necessary.

  Chalk offers extra optimizations for some data sources, but you don't need Chalk to officially support a data source to use it!

In addition to these providers, Chalk also supports Trino, Spanner, and others. For the most recent list of data sources
we offer, go to your dashboard's Data Sources tab.
