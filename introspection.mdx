Occasionally, you may need to inspect a running Chalk environment to review metadata about your configured Chalk
pipelines. You can use the provided Rest API to query for this metadata as part of your admin dashboards,
monitoring tooling, or team knowledge management.

Note: if you use a user-scoped token (i.e. one that’s derived from [`chalk login`](/cli/login)),
you will need to specify the environment in which to trigger your resolver via the X-Chalk-Env-id header.

## View an environment's live feature and resolver graph

<RequestUrl url="https://api.chalk.ai/v1/environment/graph" type="GET" />

<AttributeTable title={"Headers"}>
<Attribute field={'Authorization'} kind={'string'}>
The <a href="/docs/online-authentication#authenticating-a-request-using-an-access-token">auth token</a> that should be used for the request, such as{" "}
<code className='dark:text-white'>Authorization: Bearer $(chalk token)</code>
</Attribute>

<Attribute field={'X-Chalk-Env-Id'} kind={'string?'}>
The environment ID for which this request should be executed, if the provided Authorization token was not created with an implicit environment
</Attribute>
</AttributeTable>

### Response

<a href="#pipelines">Pipelines</a> object

### Example

```bash
curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(chalk token)" \
     -H "X-Chalk-Env-Id: <your-environment-id>" \
     https://api.chalk.ai/v1/environment/graph

# Returns

{
  "deployment_id": "<deployment-id>",
  "features": […],
