SQL resolvers enable you to load and transform data from your data sources as feature values.

## Defining SQL Resolvers

There are two ways to define SQL resolvers. The first is to write a SQL query in a file with the
`.chalk.sql` extension, and the second is to use the [`make_sql_file_resolver`](/api-docs#make_sql_file_resolver)
function, which will generate a SQL file resolver based on the function arguments at build time.

### SQL File Resolvers

To define a SQL resolver in a file, create a file with the `.chalk.sql` extension, add comments to specify
the data source the SQL query will run on and the feature class whose features it will resolve, and write
the SQL query.

```sql src/get_user.chalk.sql
-- source: pg_users
-- resolves: User

select id, name, age, hobbies from users;

```

The output column names in the SQL query must match the feature names in the feature class specified in the
`resolves` comment. The data source specified in the `source` comment must also match the name of the data
source configured in the Chalk dashboard. Each SQL file resolver must only resolve features within the
same feature class, but a resolver does not have to resolve all features within the feature class.

### Generating SQL File Resolvers

To generate SQL file resolvers at build time, use the [`make_sql_file_resolver`](/api-docs#make_sql_file_resolver)
function. This function enables you to define one or many SQL file resolvers at a time that may have slight
variations, for example querying a different data source in a different environment. The following code
would generate an equivalent SQL file resolver to the one above:

```python src/make_user_resolver.py
from chalk import make_sql_file_resolver

make_sql_file_resolver(
    name="get_user",
    source="pg_users",
    resolves="User",
    query="select id, name, age, hobbies from users;"
)
```
