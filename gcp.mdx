You can provide Chalk with a GCP application credentials
to use integrations with GCP (like [BigQuery](/docs/bigquery) and [Cloud Storage](/docs/s3)).

On your dashboard, you'll find a form for adding your credentials:

<GcpIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

You are encouraged to use different service accounts for different environments,
although they can be shared.

## Creating credentials

Credentials are [created through GCP directly](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
You'll want to make a new service key for Chalk
with the permissions you require.
Credentials are created through GCP's dashboard.
You can create a key and download it from your console
[here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create).
