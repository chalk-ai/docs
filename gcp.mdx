You can provide Chalk with a GCP application credentials
to use integrations with GCP (like [BigQuery](/docs/bigquery) and [Cloud Storage](/docs/s3)).

On your dashboard, you'll find a form for adding your credentials:

<GcpIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

You are encouraged to use different service accounts for different environments,
although they can be shared.

## Creating credentials

Credentials are [created through GCP directly](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
You'll want to make a new service key for Chalk
with the permissions you require.
Credentials are created through GCP's dashboard.
You can create a key and download it from your console
[here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create).

### BigQuery permissions

If you plan to add a BigQuery data source to your Chalk deployment, then you should ensure
that the permissions set includes `bigquery.tables.create` and `bigquery.jobs.create`.

When querying your BigQuery data source, Chalk will push down filters on top of your
queries to optimize the amount of data read from your tables. For larger queries, rather than
interpolating values directly in the SQL string for the query, which has length limits in
BigQuery, Chalk will use a table to temporarily hold the values against which to query.
