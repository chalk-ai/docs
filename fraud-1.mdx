## Introduction

Chalk helps you build out feature pipelines for training and serving machine learning models.

The building blocks of Chalk are [features](/docs/features).
Each piece of data in your system, whether a column in a database
or a value passed in at inference, is a feature.
For example, a user's age and whether they are an adult might be a
features in your system:

```python
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    age: int
    is_adult: bool
```

Features are computed by [resolvers](/docs/resolver-overview).
A resolver is a function that takes features as arguments and
outputs new features. For example, a resolver might take a user's
age and output a boolean indicating whether they are over 18.

```python
from chalk.features import online

@online
def is_adult(age: User.age) -> User.is_adult:
    return age >= 18
```

The focus on data instead of pipelines may be unfamiliar at first.
Traditional orchestration platforms
like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Dagster](https://dagster.io/)
explicitly compose functions which produce data into a DAG of tasks.
With Chalk, the DAG of [resolvers](/docs/resolver-overview) is defined implicitly by the [features](/docs/features)
they produce. This architecture makes it easy to build out feature pipelines that are reusable and composable.
Chalk handles tracking your features for [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency),
running your resolvers in parallel, and horizontally scaling your feature pipelines.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building a feature pipeline for a simple model.
We will be building a feature pipeline for a fraud detection model,
and will cover the full feature development lifecycle:

1. [Data Modeling](/docs/fraud-2) - Creating feature classes for the data we want to compute.
2. [SQL Resolvers](/docs/fraud-3) - Mapping data from SQL sources to feature classes.
3. [Python Resolvers](/docs/fraud-4) - Defining resolvers in Python that call APIs and compute derived features.
4. [Inference](/docs/fraud-5) - Integrating Chalk into production decisioning systems.
5. [Backtesting](/docs/fraud-6) - Experimenting with new features

Before you get started, make sure you have the
[Chalk CLI installed](/docs/installation).
