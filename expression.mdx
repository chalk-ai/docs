## Overview

Chalk Expressions let you define features declaratively, using symbolic computation over your data.
While you write expressions in idiomatic Python, they are compiled and executed as vectorized C++,
enabling low-latency computation at serve time and high-throughput processing at train time.

Expressions support a wide range of operations, including arithmetic, filtering, aggregations,
and built-in functions like .

For example, in a Transaction feature class, we can compute the subtotal of a transaction as the difference between its total and sales tax:

```python
from chalk.features import features, Primary
from chalk import _

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    total: float
    sales_tax: float
    subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax
```

The `_` symbol refers to the current scope (here, the feature class `Transaction`)
and is used to reference other fields on the same instance.
Expressions like `_.total - _.sales_tax` are compiled into native execution
plans that run efficiently in production.

In addition to referencing fields on the same object, you can traverse relationships.
If each `Transaction` is associated with a `User`, for example, you can compute a
string similarity between the userâ€™s name and the transaction memo:

```diff-py
+ import chalk.functions as F

  @features
  class Transaction:
      ...
      memo: str
      user: "User"
+     name_match_score: float = F.jaccard_similarity(
+       _.user.name, _.memo
+     )
```

Here, `_.user.name` follows the foreign key relationship from `Transaction` to `User`.
The function [`F.jaccard_similarity`](/api-docs#jaccard_similarity) is one of many built-in Chalk functions that
operate on symbolic expressions.

Expressions can also perform aggregations over related records.
In a `User` feature class, we can compute aggregates like the
number of large transactions or the total amount spent:

```python
from chalk import _
from chalk.features import DataFrame, features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]

    num_large_txns: int = _.transactions[_.total > 1000].count()
    total_spend: float = _.transactions[_.total].sum()
```

In this context, `_` refers to the `User` instance when referring to `_.transactions`.
But when you apply a filter, like `_.transactions[_.total > 1000]`,
the expression inside the brackets is evaluated in the context of each individual `Transaction`.
That means `_.total` refers to the total field on each `Transaction`, not on the `User`.
This scoped evaluation makes it easy to filter, project, and aggregate over related data.

All expressions are statically analyzed, optimized to eliminate redundant computation,
and executed as high-performance C++ at runtime.

## Scalar Functions

Chalk expressions support a wide range of built-in functions for manipulating data, performing calculations,
and transforming features. These functions can be used in expressions to operate on feature values, DataFrames, and other data types.

```diff-py
- from chalk import features, online
+ from chalk.features import _, features

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    total: float
    sales_tax: float
+   subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax

- @online
- def get_subtotal(total: Transaction.total, sales_tax: Transaction.sales_tax) -> Transaction.subtotal:
-     return total - sales_tax
```

### Infix Operators

Chalk expressions support a variety of infix operators for arithmetic, conditions, and boolean logic.

| Operator        | Description              | Example                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `+`             | Addition                 | `_.total + _.sales_tax`                      |
| `-`             | Subtraction              | `_.total - _.sales_tax`                      |
| `*`             | Multiplication           | `_.quantity * _.price`                       |
| `/`             | Division                 | `_.total / _.quantity`                       |
| `>`             | Greater than             | `_.total > 1000`                             |
| `>=`            | Greater than or equal    | `_.total >= 1000`                            |
| `<`             | Less than                | `_.total < 1000`                             |
| `<=`            | Less than or equal       | `_.total <= 1000`                            |
| `==`            | Equal                    | `_.status == "completed"`                    |
| `!=`            | Not equal                | `_.status != "completed"`                    |
| `&`             | Boolean and              | `_.is_active & _.is_verified`                |
| <code>\|</code> | Boolean or               | <code>\_.is\_active \| \_.is_verified</code> |
| `~`             | Boolean not              | `~_.is_active`                               |

<TipBad>Don't use `or`, `and`, `not`, and `is` in expressions</TipBad>
Do not use Python's `and`, `or`, `not`, or `is` operators in expressions.
Python does not allow these operators to be overridden, so they will not work with Chalk's expressions.

### Builtin Functions

The `chalk.functions` module exposes several helpful functions that can be used in
combination with expression references to transform features. These functions are meant
to be used in expressions and are not available as standalone functions. To view all
available functions, see our [SDK docs](/api-docs#section-chalk-functions)

### Structs

Expressions can be used to access nested attributes from other features in a feature class, whether these
other features are struct `dataclasses`, `features`, or `DataFrames`.

```python
import chalk.functions as F
from chalk.features import features
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class LatLon:
    lat: float | None
    lon: int | None

@features
class User:
    id: int
    home: LatLon
    work: LatLon
    commute_distance: float = F.haversine(
        lat1=_.home.lat,
        lon1=_.home.lon,
        lat2=_.work.lat,
        lon2=_.work.lon,
    )
```


### Custom Functions

You can create custom functions to encapsulate complex logic or reusable computations in your expressions.
For example, if you wanted to apply consistent windows across many features, you could define a custom function
like this:

<TipGood>Use helper functions to create expressions</TipGood>

```python
from chalk import _
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame

def count_where(*filters):
    return _.transactions[_.created_at > _.chalk_window, *filters].count()

@features
class User:
    id: int
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    num_large_transactions: int = count_where(_.total > 1000)
    num_small_transactions: int = count_where(_.total < 100)
```

<TipBad>Don't use expressions in Python resolvers</TipBad>

```python
@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    name_email_match_score: float

@online
def get_score(
    name: User.name,
    email: User.email,
) -> User.name_email_match_score:
    # DONT DO THIS!!
    return F.jaccard_similarity(name, email)
```

Expressions are not supported in Python resolvers, so you cannot use Chalk functions like `F.jaccard_similarity`
in a Python resolver. Instead, use expressions to define the feature directly in the feature class.

```python
@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    name_email_match_score: float = F.jaccard_similarity(
        _.name, _.email
    )
```

---

## DataFrame Functions

### Conditions and filters

DataFrame features can be [filtered](/docs/dataframe#filters) with expressions.

Extending our `Transaction` example, we can create a `User` feature class with a [has-many](/docs/has-many) relationship
to `Transaction`. Then, we can define a feature representing the number of large purchases by referencing the existing
`User.transactions` feature:

```diff-py
  from chalk.features import _, features, DataFrame

  @features
  class Transaction:
      id: int
+     user_id: "User.id"
      total: float
      sales_tax: float
      subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax

+ @features
+ class User:
+    id: int
+    # implicit has-many relationship with Transaction due to `user_id` above
+    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
+    num_large_transactions: int = _.transactions[_.total > 1000].count()
```

The object referenced by `_` changes depending on its current scope. In this code, the `_` in `_.transactions`
references the `User` object.
Within the `DataFrame` filter, the `_` in `_.total` references each `Transaction` object as each one is evaluated.
The `count` aggregation is covered in the next section.

### Projections and aggregations

DataFrame features support [projection](/docs/dataframe#projections) with expressions, which produce a new
DataFrame scoped down to the referenced columns. DataFrames can be aggregated after eligible columns are selected.

With our `Transaction` example, we already saw a `count` aggregation for counting the number of large transactions. We
can add another aggregation for computing the user's total spend:

```diff-py
from chalk.features import _, features, DataFrame

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    sales_tax: float
    subtotal: float
    total: float = _.subtotal + _.sales_tax

@features
class User:
    id: int
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    num_large_transactions: int = _.transactions[_.total > 1000].count()
+   total_spend: float = _.transactions[_.total].sum()
```

To compute `User.total_spend`, we needed to create a projection of the `User.transactions`
`DataFrame` limited to only the `Transaction.total` column so that the `sum` aggregation could work.
In contrast, no projection was needed for the `num_large_transactions` aggregation because `count`
works on `DataFrames` with any number of columns.

<TipGood>Use materialized aggregations</TipGood>

For computing low-latency aggregations over high volumes of data, Chalk also offers
[materialized windowed aggregations](/docs/materialized_aggregations)
that uses materialization of buckets of data to compute large aggregations efficiently.

### Aggregation functions

Aggregation functions have varying behavior when handling `None` values and empty `DataFrames`.
If an aggregation function says `None` values are skipped in the table below,
it will consider a `DataFrame` with only `None` values as empty.

| Function                 | `None` values | Empty DataFrame   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------- |-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sum`                    | Skipped       | Returns `0`       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `min`                    | Skipped       | Returns `None`    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `max`                    | Skipped       | Returns `None`    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `mean`                   | Skipped       | Returns `None`    | Feature type must be `float` or `float \| None`. `None` values are skipped, meaning they are not included in the mean calculation.                                                                                           |
| `count`                  | Included      | Returns `0`       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `any`                    | Skipped       | Returns `False`   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `all`                    | Skipped       | Returns `True`    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `std`                    | Skipped       | See notes         | Standard deviation. Requires at least 2 values. For DataFrames with less than 2 values, returns `None`. <br/> Aliases: `stddev`, `stddev_sample`, `std_sample`.                                                              |
| `var`                    | Skipped       | See notes         | Variance. Same requirements as `std`. <br/> Alias: `var_sample`.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `approx_count_distinct`  | Skipped       | Returns `0`       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `approx_percentile`      | Skipped       | Returns `None`    | Takes one argument, `quantile`, expected to be a float in the range `[0, 1]`. <br/> Example: `approx_percentile(0.75)` returns a value approximately equal to the 75th percentile of the not-`None` values in the DataFrame. |
| `approx_top_k`           | Skipped       | Returns `None`      | Takes one argument, `k`, expected to be a positive integer, as a keyword argument. <br/> Example: `approx_top_k(k=25)` returns the 25 or fewer approximately-most common values.

For aggregations that can return `None`, either mark the feature as optional
(for example, by setting the feature type to `float | None`) or use [`coalesce`](/api-docs#coalesce)
to fall back to a default value.

---

## Run conditions

To specify run conditions such as environment, tags, and versions for a feature
that is resolved through an expression,
you can use the [`feature`](/api-docs#feature) function and pass in the expression as an argument.

```python
from chalk.features import Primary, features, feature

@features
class User:
    id: int

    purchases: DataFrame[Purchase]
    # Uses a default value of 0 when one cannot be computed.
    num_purchases: int = feature(
        expression=_.purchases.count(),
        default=0,
        environment=["staging", "dev"],
        tags=["fraud", "credit"],
        version=1,
    )
```

---

## Testing

To test your expressions, we recommend setting up [integration tests](/docs/integration-tests) or
iterating on a branch.


---

## Dynamic Expressions

In some cases, you may want to build expressions dynamically.
For example, if you have a rules engine that generates expressions
and stores them in a database, you can load those expressions at runtime
and ask Chalk to compute their values.

Consider this `User` and `Transaction` model, which would be checked in to the code:

```python
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    user: "User"
    total: float
    sales_tax: float

@features
class User:
    id: int
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    name: str
    email: str
```

Using the [Golang](https://github.com/chalk-ai/chalk-go#querying-for-expressions)
or [Python](https://docs.chalk.ai/docs/notebook-development#building-new-features)
SDKs, you can compute both scalar and aggregate features on demand.

For example, in Golang, if we wanted to compare the lowercased name and email
by their Jaccard similarity, we could build the expression dynamically and ask
Chalk to compute it:

```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/zeebo/assert"
	"github.com/chalk-ai/chalk-go/expr"
	"github.com/chalk-ai/chalk-go"
)

func TestQueryingExpressions(t *testing.T) {
	// Picks up the ambient credentials from the `chalk login` run on the CLI.
	client, err := chalk.NewGRPCClient(t.Context())
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	result, err := client.OnlineQueryBulk(
		t.Context(),
		chalk.OnlineQueryParams{}.
			WithInput("user.id", []int{1}).
			WithOutputs("user.name").
			WithOutputs("user.email").
			WithOutputExprs(
				expr.FunctionCall(
					"jaccard_similarity",
					expr.FunctionCall("lower", expr.Col("name")),
					expr.FunctionCall("lower", expr.Col("email")),
				).
					As("user.name_email_sim"),
			),
	)
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	row, err := result.GetRow(0)
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	for feature, value := range row.Features {
		t.Logf("Feature: %s, Value: %+v", feature, value.Value)
	}
}
```

This program produces output like this:

```
=== RUN   TestChalkClient
    chalk_test.go:46: Feature: user.name, Value: Nicole Mann
    chalk_test.go:46: Feature: user.email, Value: nicoleam@nasa.gov
    chalk_test.go:46: Feature: user.name_email_sim, Value: 0.5714285714285714
--- PASS: TestChalkClient (0.43s)
```

The feature `user.name_email_sim` was computed using the expression
`jaccard_similarity(lower(name), lower(email))`, which was built dynamically
using the `expr` package.

For a complete list of functions, see our [SDK docs](/api-docs#section-chalk-functions).
All the functions available in expressions are also available in the `expr` package.

You can also compute aggregations dynamically.
Using the Golang SDK, we can compute the number of large transactions for a user:

```go
result, err := client.OnlineQueryBulk(
    t.Context(),
    chalk.OnlineQueryParams{}.
        WithInput("user.id", []int{1}).
        WithOutputExprs(
            expr.DataFrame("transactions").
                Filter(expr.Col("amount").Gt(expr.Float(0.))).
                Agg("count").
                As("user.positive_transaction_count"),
        ),
)
```

For this program, the output would look like this:

```
=== RUN   TestChalkClient
    chalk_test.go:42: Feature: user.positive_transaction_count, Value: 33
--- PASS: TestChalkClient (0.45s)
```

In a Python expression, the above SDK call is equivalent to:

```python
User.positive_transaction_count = _.transactions[_.amount > 0].count()
```

Both the scalar functions and aggregations can be computed in Python SDK.
See [this guide](/docs/notebook-development#building-new-features) for more details.
