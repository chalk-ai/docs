title: BigQuery Export
description: Configuration for feature export to BigQuery
---


## Background

Chalk store structured logs of all features computed or ingested by the platform.
Chalk can export these logs to a BigQuery dataset in your GCP project so that you can
perform custom analysis and reporting on the data.

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a BigQuery Dataset

Feature logs are stored per-environment. You will need to create one or more BigQuery datasets to
receive the exported features. We typically recommend creating one dataset per Chalk environment
to keep the data organized.

### 2. Grant Chalk Access to the Dataset

Chalk Support will provide the ID of a "management" service account originating from the GCP project that
stores your feature logs. You will need to grant this service account permission to manipulate schemas
and execute queries in the relevant datasets.

The IAM permissions required are:

```
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.jobs.delete
bigquery.jobs.get
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.createIndex
bigquery.tables.delete
bigquery.tables.deleteIndex
bigquery.tables.export
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.getIamPolicy
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.setCategory
bigquery.tables.setIamPolicy
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.tables.updateData
bigquery.tables.updateTag
```

Note: the `bigquery.tables.*` permissions and `bigquery.datasets.get` permission are only required on the datasets
created in step #1.

### 3. Configure the Export

You will need to provide Chalk with the following information to configure the export:

- The GCP project ID where the BigQuery dataset is located
- The BigQuery dataset ID

Chalk will then configure the export and begin sending feature logs to the dataset.
