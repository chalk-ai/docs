import { TipBad, TipGood } from '@/components/Tip'

Resolvers can depend on other features to compute their features.
These dependencies are declared through the type signature of the
arguments to the resolver function.

## Scalar dependencies

To depend on features from a [Feature Set](/docs/features),
label your resolver arguments with your features as the types.
You can then use those arguments in the body of your resolver to
compute your [output features](/docs/resolver-outputs).
If you're running our [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup),
your editor will see the type of each variable as the type
of the underlying scalar.

```py
from chalk.features import features, online

@features
class User:
    id: str
    email: str
    email_domain: str

@online
def get_domain(email: User.email) -> User.email_domain:
    # type(email) == str
    return email.split('@')[1].lower()
```

You can require multiple features in a resolver.
However, all feature dependencies in a single resolver
need to originate in the same root namespace:

<TipGood>Requiring features from the same root namespace</TipGood>

```py
@online
def fn(a: User.email, b: User.name) -> User.email_name_match:
    return ...
```

Here, we incorrectly request features from the root namespaces
of `Transfer` and `User`:

<TipBad>Requiring features from different root namespaces</TipBad>

```py
@online
def fn(a: User.email, b: Transfer.memo) -> Transfer.email_in_memo:
    return email in memo
```

If you want to require features from namespaces,
you can use [has-one](/docs/has-one) or
[has-many](/docs/has-many) relationships.

<TipGood>Requiring features from different root namespaces using a relationship</TipGood>

```py
@online
def fn(email: Transfer.user.email, memo: Transfer.memo) -> Transfer.email_in_memo:
    return email in memo
```

---

## Has-one dependencies

### Scalar has-one

You can also require features joined to a
[Feature Set](/docs/features) through
[has-one](/docs/has-one) relationships.
For example, if users in your system have bank accounts,
and you wanted to compare the name on the user's bank account
to the user's name, you could require the user's name and
the account's title through the user:

```py
@online
def name_sim(title: User.account.title, name: User.full_name) -> ...
```

You can also require all scalars on the user's profile:

```py
@online
def fn(profile: User.profile) -> ...:
    profile.signup_date
```

Chalk will materialize all scalar features on the profile
before calling this function.
If you want to pull only a few features from the profile,
require each directly:

```py
@online
def fn(signup_date: User.profile.signup_date, age: User.profile.age) -> ...
```

### Optional has-one

Has-one relationships can also be
[declared as optional](/docs/has-one#optional-relationships).
You may also require feature through optional relationships,
but the types for all of those optional features will become
optional. Consider the below example:

```py
@features
class Account:
    id: int
    user_id: int
    balance: float  # Non-optional balance

@features
class User:
    id: int
    # Optional relationship
    account: Account | None = has_one(lambda: Account.user_id == User.id)
    has_high_balance: bool

@online
def has_high_bal(balance: User.account.balance) -> User.has_high_balance:
    # Balance will be "float | None"
    if balance is None:
        return False
    return balance > 1000

```

The resolver in this example receives an optional `float`,
even though `balance` is not an optional field on `Account`.
The optional is added because the user may not have an account,
in which case the resolver will receive `None` for the balance.

### Nested has-one

You can also traverse nested [has-one](/docs/has-one)
relationships in the same manner as
[requiring a single has-one](#has-one-dependencies).

Consider a schema where users have a feature set of profile information,
and the user's profile has an identity feature set, which in turn
has the age of the user's email.
You can require the email age feature as below:

```py
@online
def fn(email_age: User.profile.identity.email_age) -> ...
```

However, you cannot access nested relationships without
explicit asking for them.

<TipBad>Accessing a transitive relationship from a dependency.</TipBad>

```py
@online
def fn(acct: User.account) -> ...:
    acct.balance           # Ok
    acct.institution.name  # Error!
```

Instead, you can require the nested relationship directly
and access any of its scalar features.

<TipGood>Directly requiring the transitive relationship.</TipGood>

```py
@online
def fn(ins: User.account.institution, acct: User.account) -> ...:
    acct.balance  # Ok
    ins.name      # Ok
```

The semantics of
[optional has-one dependencies](#optional-has-one)
carry over to nested has-one dependencies.
If you traverse an optional relationship,
then all downstream attributes will become optional.

## Has-many dependencies

### Scalar has-many

You can also require [has-many relationships](/docs/has-many)
as inputs to your resolver:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers) -> ...:
```

You receive a [Chalk DataFrame](/docs/dataframe),
which supports
[projections](/docs/dataframe#projections),
[filtering](/docs/dataframe#filters), and
[aggregations](/docs/dataframe#aggregations),
among other operations.

### Projections

By default, Chalk will materialize all scalar features
on the `Transfer` feature set before calling your resolver.
As an optimization hint, you can specify which features from
the transfers that you'd like Chalk to materialize before calling
the function. For example, if there were expensive features
to compute on the transfer, you could scope the features
to only the set you need:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.memo]) -> ...:
    transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()      # Ok
    transfers[Transfer.from_institution]  # Error: filtered out above
```

The error above is surfaced statically
by our [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup).


### Filtering

You can apply filters to the has-many inputs of resolvers:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount > 100]) -> ...:
```

[Filters](/docs/dataframe#filters) can be composed with
[projections](/docs/dataframe#projections) following the semantics
of the Chalk `DataFrame`.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount > 100, Transfer.memo]) -> ...:
```

Filters can also be used on features through has-one relationships.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.bank.location == "USA"]) -> ...:
```

More on projection and filtering [here](/docs/dataframe#composing-projections-and-filters)

### Has-many through has-one

Has-many relationships can be required through has-one relationships:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.account.transfers) -> ...:
```

As with [scalar has-many dependencies](#scalar-has-many),
you can scope down the scalar features on the transfer
to only those required:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.account.transfers[Transfer.amount]) -> ...:
    transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()      # Ok
    transfers[Transfer.from_institution]  # Error: filtered out above
```

### Has-many through optional-has-one

If the has-one relationship that you're traversing is
[optional](/docs/has-one#optional-relationships),
then the `transfers` argument in the example above will
either be `None` or a [Chalk DataFrame](/docs/dataframe).

### Has-one through has-many

You can also select columns through nested has-one relationships that would not normally materialize.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.bank.name]) -> ...:
```

In the above example, if there was a has-one relationship between `Transfer` and `Bank`,
we can fetch any scalar feature from `Bank` as well for the `DataFrame`.
Note that the `Bank.name` column would _not_ materialize with the simple `transfers: User.transfers` typing,
since this typing only materializes scalar features in the root namespace.

### Has-many through has-many

Has-many relationships can be required through other has-many relationships.

For example, consider the following feature definitions for `User`, `Account`, and `Transaction`,
where a user can have many accounts, each with many transactions.

```py
from chalk.features import features, has_many, DataFrame


@features
class Transaction:
    id: str
    account_id: str
    amount: float


@features
class Account:
    id: str
    user_id: str
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction] = has_many(
        lambda: Transaction.account_id == Account.id
    )


@features
class User:
    id: str
    total_spent: float
    accounts: DataFrame[Account] = has_many(lambda: Account.user_id == User.id)
```

We can resolve the `total_spent` feature on `User` by computing the sum of transaction
amounts across all of a user's accounts, as shown below.

```python
@online
def get_total_spent(
    txns: User.accounts.transactions[Transaction.amount]
) -> User.total_spent:
    return txns.sum()
```
