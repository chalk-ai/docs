By default, features are timestamped with the execution time of their resolver.
However, [you can override this behavior by providing timestamps from your data
source](/docs/features#overriding-output-time).

## Interaction with the online store

Features with overriden observation timestamps are treated specially when inserted into the online store.
In particular, Chalk will always check for existing "newer" feature values in the online store
before inserting historically dated feature values. This means that you can safely ingest large quantities
of backdated features without accidentally ingesting stale data into the online store.

Additionally, once features are inserted into the online store, Chalk tracks the source observation timestamps
when these feature values are returned as part of online queries. Chalk uses these source timestamps
to compute the "feature staleness" metric. Staleness in this context is defined as "query time - observation time".

## Interaction with the offline store

Features with overriden observation timestamps are inserted into the offline store with the timestamp that you
specify. The observation timestamp works like an "effective as of" timestamp, so if you insert something like this:

```
| id | feature | value | timestamp            |
|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | age     | 7     | 2022-02-01T00:00:00Z |
```

into an offline store that already contained these observations:

```
| id | feature | value | timestamp            |
|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | age     | 6     | 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z |
| 1  | age     | 8     | 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z |
```

then the observation will be interleaved "in between" the existing observations, and you would see the following query
results:

```
id, age, <= 2022-02-01
output: 7

id, age, <= 2022-03-02
output: 8

id, age, <= 2022-01-02
output: 6
```
