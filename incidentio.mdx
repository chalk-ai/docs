Chalk supports integration with [incident.io](https://incident.io/) for alerting.

## Creating a Chalk Alert Source

To connect incident.io to Chalk, you'll need to create a new HTTP alert source from your incident.io dashboard.

Once you create an HTTP alert source, you will be given the option of `Header authentication` and `Query authentication`.
You will want to select `Query authentication` and copy the URL. It should be of the form:
https://api.incident.io/v2/alert_events/http/`alert_source_id`?token=`alert_source_token`

For more information, see [incident.io's Alert Guide](https://incident.io/changelog/automate-incident-creation-with-alerts)

## Adding to Chalk

Once you have the URL copied, you can insert it on your environment settings page under incident.io.
You can either paste the entire URL or input the `alert_source_id` and `alert_source_token` manually.

Integrations are per-environment, but you can create more than one HTTP source per Chalk environment
and create separate incident.io alert routes for each.
