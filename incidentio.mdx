Chalk supports integration with [IncidentIo](https://incident.io/) for incident handling.

## Creating an integration key

To connect IncidentIo to Chalk, you'll need to generate an integration API key from
your IncidentIo settings page.

To generate an API key, navigate to `API keys` in the settings page, 
Click `Add new` in the top right corner. You will need to ensure that
the permissions include `Create incidents` and `View catalog types and entries`.
Copy the `Integration Key` into your dashboard in the settings.

For more information, see
[IncidentIo's guide](https://incident.io/blog/api#1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3generate-an-api-key-in-incidentio)
to creating an integration key.

## Adding to Chalk

Once you have an integration key, you can insert it on your environment settings page.

Integrations are per-environment but you can use more than one integration key per
Chalk environment and create seperate IncidentIo workflows for each. 

By default, IncidentIo only has Minor, Major, and Critical severities. Chalk errors will
default to Minor unless Critical is set in the Metric Chart Alert Configuration.
This behavior is able to be modified using IncidentIo workflows that select on the API key
and incident severity.
