description: Learn about Chalk's billing model and how to optimize costs.

Chalk charges for machine uptime of nodes labeled as `Chalk Managed`. We calculate this by
multiplying:

* The instance type
* Chalk’s credit utilization rate/hour for that instance type
* The number of hours (i.e., uptime) that the node remains active.
Rather than rounding to the nearest hour, Chalk meters usage in 10-second increments.

Regardless of the load placed on a Chalk-managed node, credit usage remains the same.
We charge for the node’s uptime, not based on the level of activity within the node.
You can run unlimited queries or create multiple branches without incurring extra charges.
Billing is based solely on the node’s active hours, not on how many features or branches are used.

## Finding Chalk Credit Rates

To see the full list of credit utilization rates per hour for all machine types, log into Chalk
via your terminal and use the Chalk CLI command to view usage rates.

```bash
$ chalk login
$ chalk usage rates
```

## Cost Optimization Tips

There are two primary ways to optimize your resource configurations for cost optimization.

### Configure Auto-Shutdown Periods

The branch server can be configured to automatically shut down after a window of inactivity. To set this
window of inactivity, go to `Settings > Resources > Branch Server Configurations` in the dashboard.
After the specified window of inactivity, the server automatically shuts down, halting costs. If the
branch server is shut down and activity is detected, including branch deployments and queries, then the
branch server will automatically spin back up.

### Configure Resource Configurations

For the other nodes in your cluster, you can configure the resource configurations according to your needs
in the dashboard under `Settings > Resources > Resource Configurations`. You can select the instance type
for each server that is right for you, and set a scaling policy that ensures that you scale up when traffic
is high, but notably that your nodes scale down when traffic is low.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I get charged for pods or for nodes?

You are charged per node. Multiple Chalk pods on a single node does not change the amount of the credit
utilization.

### What if we are running non-Chalk workloads on the same cluster?

Chalk only applies charges to nodes labeled “Chalk Managed.” Other workloads on different nodes do not
incur Chalk charges. You can also configure your cluster to have isolated nodepools to ensure that
unrelated workloads are completely isolated from your Chalk Managed nodes.

### Do more branches cost more money?

No. Because one pod runs all branches, there is no extra cost for having multiple branches.

### Do I get charged if nobody is running queries but the node is still up?

Yes, if the node is up, you are accumulating costs. You can mitigate this by setting the auto-shutdown
period for the branch server for periods of inactivity, as well as by configuring a scaling policy for
your other workloads.

### Does Chalk charge for storage or staging environments?

Chalk only charges for compute resources (i.e., running nodes). If a staging environment is idle or shut
down, it won’t incur costs.
