## Introduction

Chalk's platform is a powerful tool that allows data engineers
and data scientists to collaborate efficiently and effectively.

In this project we'll create features related to `Users`and their credit scores. We'll combine data from an
API and a database to help us decide whether we should issue
new loans.

You will learn how to create a new Chalk project,
create features and resolvers, deploy them to the Chalk
environment, and query the environment using the
[Chalk CLI](/cli/) and a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

This tutorial will take about 45 minutes to complete
end-to-end.

## Installing the Required Software

1. If you don't have a favorite IDE, install VS Code by
visiting the [download site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
and running the appropriate installer.
2. You'll also want to [install](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)
the `code` CLI command.
3. If you haven't already, install Python. You can do
this through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as follows:
```bash Terminal
# Install Homebrew
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Use Homebrew to install python3
$ brew install python
```

If you're having trouble installing Python, follow the
instructions in [Python's docs](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).

4. Install the [Chalk CLI](/cli/) by running
```bash Terminal
$ curl -s -L https://api.chalk.ai/install.sh | sh
```

---

## Creating your Chalk project

Now that all of your software is installed, let's create
a Chalk project where you will add your features and
resolvers.

1. Create a folder and call it `chalk-tutorial`.
2. Run [`chalk init`](/cli/init) from inside the `chalk-tutorial`
to initialize your project files.
This will create two files for you: `chalk.yaml` and `.chalkignore`.
The first file, `chalk.yaml`, contains configuration information about
your project. The second file, `.chalkignore`, tells your
[Chalk CLI](/cli/) tool which files to ignore when deploying
to your Chalk environment. You can edit this file and use it
just like a `.gitignore` file.
```bash Terminal
$ mkdir chalk-tutorial
$ cd chalk-tutorial
$ chalk init
Created project config file chalk.yaml
Created .chalkignore file
```
3. Now edit the `chalk.yaml` file and set the `project` field to the
name of your Chalk project. This might be `chalk-tutorial`, but check
by visiting the Projects page.
4. Login by typing [`chalk login`](/cli/login).
If you're using a dedicated environment,
make sure you use the [`--api-host`](/cli/chalk#api-host) flag.
Type `y` when prompted and login in the browser.

Now you're ready to deploy code and query the environment!

## Create a virtual environment

We're going to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
so that you can download and use Python libraries
in your Chalk project.

1. Run the following command from inside your Chalk project
to create and activate your virtual environment.
When you want to deactivate your virtual environment,
type `deactivate`.
```bash Terminal
$ python3 -m venv chalk-tutorial-venv
$ source chalk-tutorial-venv/bin/activate
```
2. Your `requirements.txt` file tells your virtual environment
(and Chalk) which libraries to install. We'll use a few
libraries for this tutorial, so add the following to the
`requirements.txt`. Feel free to add more libraries later.
```txt requirements.txt
chalkpy
pydantic
requests
```
3. Install the requirements.
```bash Terminal
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Check that the libraries are installed by importing
`requests` in Python. If there's no error message, it
worked. Exit by typing `exit()` and hitting enter.
```bash Terminal
$ python3
>>> import requests
>>> exit()
```

### Use Curl and Jupyter to call APIs.

Now that all the software is installed and ready to use,
you're ready to start integrating an API.

1. First, lets test the API we're going to use.
Run this command to hit the API from your command line.
Here we're asking "give me the credit score for user 12"
and the API gives us back a JSON object with a credit score.
```bash Terminal
$ curl https://credit-report.chalk.dev/rutter_score/12
{"score":98}
```
Now you should try to hit this API from Python using a
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

2. Open VS Code, and create a new file `File -> New File`.
Select `Jupyter Notebook`.
3. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) will probably ask you which interpreter to use.
If it does, select the virtual environment you created before
(`chalk-tutorial-venv`).
4. If not, you can select it manually.
![Select Jupyter virtual environment](/img/chalk-tutorial-venv-jupyter.png)
5. Finally, let's query the API from [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Enter the following
code and run it with `shift+enter`.
```python Jupyter
import requests
requests.get(
    "https://credit-report.chalk.dev/rutter_score/12"
).json()["score"]
```

If you see 98, congratulations! You're all setup and ready
to start developing your Chalk project.

## Building a Chalk project

With all the pre-requisites completed, let's jump right
into building your Chalk project.

### Creating your first Chalk feature

We'll create a feature called `User` with a "Rutter score"
property. The resolver will call the "Rutter" API we tested
earlier, passing the User ID, and return the score.
After you deploy the feature, you will test it in
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

1. Create a `credit.py` file and copy in the feature and
resolver definitions below:
```python credit.py
import requests
from chalk.features import online, features, Features

@features
class User:
    id: str
    credit_score: int

@online
def get_credit_score(
    id: User.id,
) -> Features[User.credit_score]:
    return requests.get(
        f"https://credit-report.chalk.dev/rutter_score/{id}"
    ).json()["score"]
```
2. Deploy your code. Pass the [`--branch`](/cli/apply#branch) flag with a name
so that you don't affect the "actual" environment

```bash Terminal
chalk apply --branch test
```

3. Now lets query for your feature from your [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
Enter and execute the following code in your notebook.
```python Jupyter
from credit import User
from chalk.client import ChalkClient
ChalkClient().query(
   input={User.id: 'u_F6zY0tE4w8'},
   output=[User.credit_score],
   branch="test"
)
```
You can also query for this feature in your terminal:

```bash Terminal
$ chalk query --in user.id=u_F6zY0tE4w8 \
              --out user.credit_score \
              --branch test
```

Congratulations! You've written your first Chalk feature,
connected it to an external API, and queried it from a
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). This is a big achievement!

## Adding a database to Chalk

We have a database containing more information about users,
and it would be good to combine that information together
on our user feature.

1. If you have [psql](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows/)
or similar tool installed, you can preview the database from the command line.
When prompted, the password is `postgres`.
```bash Terminal
psql -U postgres -p 5432 -h 35.188.7.252 -d postgres
postgres=> select * from users limit 10;
```
Notice that we know `name`, `surname`, `email`, `birthday`, and
`is_fraud`, a flag that tells us whether we know this user
has committed fraud in the past.

2. To use this in your Chalk project, we'll add the database
through the UI. Navigate to your environment, and find
"Data Sources" on the left hand navigation.
3. If you see the database already, great, you can skip the
next step of adding the database. Otherwise, continue.
4. Click `Add a Data Source` and choose `PostgreSQL`.
5. Fill out the fields as shown here. The password is `postgres`.
![Postgres](/img/tutorial_postgres.png)

### Write a resolver that resolves a database

1. Add the fields from the database to the `User` feature class
you created before. The properties `name`, `surname`, and
`email` are strings. Birthday is a date, and `is_fraud`
is a boolean. (Hint: you may have to add `from datetime import date` to your credit.py file)
2. Add the datasource to your Python context. Add the below
code to your `credit.py` file. This tells Python about
your datasource.
```py credit.py
from chalk.sql import PostgreSQLSource
user_pg = PostgreSQLSource(name="User_PG")
```
3. You can use a [SQL File Resolver](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers)
to pull this information. Create a new file called
`users.chalk.sql` and copy the below contents:
```sql users.chalk.sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: user
-- source: postgres
-- count: 1
select name, surname, email, birthday, is_fraud from users where id=${user.id}
```
4. After deploying (remember to use `--branch` with the name you specified, for example "test"),
query your feature. Supplying `User` as the output
tells Chalk to give you back ALL the features of `User`.
```py Jupyter
res = client.query(
    input={User.id: 'u_F6zY0tE4w8'},
    output=[User],
    branch="test"
)
```
You can also query for this feature in your terminal:

```bash Terminal
$ chalk query --in user.id=u_F6zY0tE4w8 \
              --out user \
              --deployment test
```
