Chalk supports [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
as a [SQL source](/docs/sql).
You can configure the MySQL-specific
options using the `MySQLSource` **init** args,
or configure the source through your dashboard, and
reference the source in your code.

## Adding MySQL

On the dashboard, you can plug in the configuration for your
MySQL database:

<AddMySQLIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

## Integrations Setup

After configuring your MySQL integration in the dashboard, define your data sources in Python:

```py
from chalk.sql import MySQLSource

risk = MySQLSource(name="RISK")
marketing = MySQLSource(name="MARKETING")
```

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `RISK` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: RISK
SELECT id, credit_score FROM users
```

And to query from the `MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: MARKETING
SELECT id, email, campaign_status FROM users
```

<span>{getEnvironmentVariableText("RISK", "MYSQL_HOST")}</span>
