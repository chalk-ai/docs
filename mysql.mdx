Chalk supports [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
as a [SQL source](/docs/sql).
You can configure the MySQL-specific
options using the `MySQLSource` **init** args,
or configure the source through your dashboard, and
reference the source in your code.

## Adding MySQL

On the dashboard, you can plug in the configuration for your
MySQL database:

<AddMySQLIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />


## Single Integration

If you have only one MySQL connection that you'd like
to add to Chalk, you do not need to specify any arguments
to construct the source in your code.

```py
from chalk.sql import MySQLSource

mysql = MySQLSource()
```

You can then use [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) to query your database:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: mysql
SELECT id, name, email FROM users
```

## Multiple Integrations

<span>{getNamedIntegrationText()}</span>

```py
from chalk.sql import MySQLSource

risk = MySQLSource(name="**RISK**")
marketing = MySQLSource(name="**MARKETING**")
```

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `RISK` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: RISK
SELECT id, credit_score FROM users
```

And to query from the `MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: MARKETING
SELECT id, email, campaign_status FROM users
```

<span>{getEnvironmentVariableText("RISK", "MYSQL_HOST")}</span>
