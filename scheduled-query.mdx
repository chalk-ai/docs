When features are coming from a single SQL file, or a single resolver,
you can use [resolver crons](/docs/resolver-cron) to keep your online
and offline stores up to date.

However, when features are chained together, or when you need to run
a feature pipeline on a schedule, you can use scheduled queries.

Scheduled queries let you run an offline query on a schedule,
and persist the results in the online and/or offline feature stores.

---

## Create a Scheduled Query

To create a scheduled query, make a [ScheduledQuery](/api-docs#ScheduledQuery)
object somewhere in your code. Crontabs can be used to specify the
schedule in the UTC timezone.

```python
from chalk import ScheduledQuery

ScheduledQuery(
    name="enrich-transactions",
    schedule="0 0 * * *",
    output=[Transaction.clean_name, Transaction.category],
    store_online=True,
    store_offline=True,
)
```

At the time of [`chalk apply`](/cli/apply), the scheduled query will be
created.

In the web, you can see the list of scheduled queries in `Scheduled Runs` tab.
Each run will show the status of the last execution, and you can click into
each run to see the logs.

## Incrementalization

By default, scheduled queries use incrementalization to only ingest data which
has been updated since the last run. You can also set a resolver to use as the
source of the incrementalization. For example, if you were enriching financial
transaction data, you might use the `transactions.chalk.sql` resolver as the
source of incrementalization.

```python
from chalk import ScheduledQuery

ScheduledQuery(
    name="enrich-transactions",
    schedule="0 0 * * *",
    output=[Transaction.clean_name, Transaction.category],
    online=True,
    offline=True,
    incremental_resolvers="transactions",
)
```

---

## Monitoring

You can monitor the status of scheduled queries in the `Scheduled Runs` tab.
From there, you can set up alerts to notify you when a scheduled query fails.
To set up an alert, click on the `Add Alert` button in the top right corner of the
page.

All alerts integrate with your other [Chalk alerting integrations](/docs/alertconfig), including
email, [PagerDuty](/docs/pagerduty), [Slack](/docs/slack), and [incident.io](/docs/incidentio).
