## What are feature versions

Feature versions allow you to manage a feature as its
definition changes over time. You can reference versions
of a feature when querying, in resolvers, in migrations,
and anywhere you use features!

The ability to maintain multiple versions of a feature is
especially useful as your use cases evolve and the definition
of a feature changes. This might be because your old feature
had a bug, or maybe you want to improve the feature to be
even more useful.

Changing the definition of a feature can have unexpected
side effects, especially when there might be many consumers
of a feature, some of which you may be unaware of.
Feature versions allow you to update the feature definition
without worrying that you might affect these consumers
unknowingly.

Try it out yourself with this [tutorial](/docs/feature-version-tutorial).

## Definition

To define a versioned feature, supply the `version` keyword
argument to the `feature` function. This allows you to
continue adding versions without affecting past versions.

```python
@features
class Trial:
    id: int
    code: str = feature(version=2)
```

---

## Querying

You can refer to a specific version of a feature using the
`@` operator. You can query versioned features from any client,
including the CLI, Python, etc.

```bash
$ chalk query --in trial.id=1 --out trial.code@2
```

---

## Default versions

When you define a versioned feature, that feature always
has a default version. When you reference a versioned feature
without the `@` operator, you reference the default version.
The default version can be controlled by adding the
`default_version` keyword argument to the feature function.
If no `default_version` is provided, the default version is `1`.
It is best practice to leave the default as `1` until all
consumers have been updated to use a newer version.

```python
@features
class Trial:
    id: int
    code: str = feature(version=2, default_version=2)
```

---

## Resolvers

Resolvers also reference versioned features with `@`.
Resolvers can take versions of a feature as input, return
them as output, or both. Chalk will always generate the
right version of a feature when chaining resolvers that
require versioned features.

### Requesting versioned features

```python
@online
def fn(code: Trial.code) -> Trial.failed:
    # Default version is 1.
    return code in {'failed', 'err'}

@online
def fn2(code: Trial.code@2) -> Trial.failed:
    # Version 2 is specifically requested.
    return code in {'FAILED', 'ERR'}
```

### Producing versioned features

```python
@online
def fn(d: Trial.raw_data) -> Trial.code @ 1:
    return d['code']

@online
def fn2(d: Trial.raw_data) -> Trial.code @ 2:
    return d['data']['code']
```

## Limitations

Only scalar features can be versioned. Other kinds of
features cannot be versioned. These include:
* `has_one` and `has_many`
* `FeatureTime` 
* `Windowed`
* `Primary`
