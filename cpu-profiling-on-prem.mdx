When running Chalk in your own cloud environment, you may want to profile the CPU usage of your Chalk deployment in order
to diagnose performance issues or optimize resource usage. Chalk supports CPU profiling using Linux [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page).

## Deploying a Profile-enabled Chalk Deployment

By default, Chalk's platform is compiled with debug symbols stripped & high optimization levels. To enable profiling,
you'll need to deploy an alternate build of Chalk with debug symbols and lower optimization levels. This
may slightly impact the performance of your Chalk deployment, so it's recommended to only deploy this build when
you need to profile CPU usage.

## Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of profiling the CPU usage of your Chalk deployment. No sensitive
information will be shared with Chalk during this process.

1. Run [`chalk apply --enable-profiling`](/cli/apply)
2. Wait until your new deployment is complete
3. Run `kubectl exec -it <the-name-of-a-query-server-pod> /bin/bash`
4. Run `perf record -F 99 -g -p 7 --call-graph dwarf`
5. Submit online queries to generate activity
6. Hit "ctrl+c" after about 30 seconds to stop the profiling
7. Run `perf script -F +pid > /out.perf` to add debug symbols to the profiling data.
8. Run `kubectl cp <the-name-of-the-query-server-pod>:/out.perf .`
9. Submit `out.perf` to Chalk

Note that `-p 7` means "profile process 7". You may need to use `htop` to find the process ID of the query server.

## Analyzing the Profile

There are a variety of tools that are available to analyze the profile data. One popular tool is the
[Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/). Chalk's support team is also happy to help.
