Chalk implements OAuth for authentication to the online query interface.
Two kinds of credentials can be used to access Chalk resources:

- **Personal Credentials:** Full access to all resources on your account. This allows a client to act as you.
- **Service Credentials:** Access scoped to a specific project and environment. Used for computers to talk to Chalk. Generated via the web dashboard.

Both personal and service credentials can be used to query Chalk, and potentially to modify your Chalk deployment's
settings. This means that **these credentials are sensitive and must be kept secret.**

You can create and manage service credentials in the Chalk dashboard or using the [Chalk CLI](/cli/chalk).
When you use the CLI to create credentials, you will be asked to authenticate yourself on Chalk's web dashboard.
Then, you will receive a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Once generated, `client_id` cannot be changed. However,
`client_secret` can be rotated if your security practices require this or if you suspect that `client_secret` has
been compromised.

Once you have generated your `client_id` and `client_secret`, you can make authenticated requests to Chalk.

## Authenticating an API client

Chalk has published API client libraries for several languages. These libraries handle exchanging a `client_id`
and `client_secret` for an `access_token` which can be used to access Chalk.

## Authenticating CURL

We recommend using the chalk cli tool to authenticate a curl request. You can use `chalk token` to acquire an
`access_token` that is suitable for use as a `Bearer token`:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(chalk token)" \
  https://api.chalk.ai/v1/who-am-i
```

## Fetching an Access Token

If you're implementing a custom API client for a language that Chalk hasn't published a library for, you may need to
fetch an `access_token` using the [OAuth Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/)
grant flow. You can use the `token` endpoint in Chalk's API to execute this flow:

### Request

<RequestUrl url="https://api.chalk.ai/v1/oauth/token" type="POST" />

<AttributeTable>

<Attribute field={'client_id'} kind={'string'}>
  Your client_id
</Attribute>

<Attribute field={'client_secret'} kind={'string'}>
  Your client_secret
</Attribute>

<Attribute field="grant_type" kind="client_credentials">
  The grant_type field must always be "client_credentials".
</Attribute>

</AttributeTable>

### Response

<AttributeTable>

<Attribute field={"access_token"} kind={"string"}>
The access_token that you should use in the Authorization header for authenticated requests.
</Attribute>
<Attribute field={"expires_in"} kind={"int"}>
Number of seconds until the access_token expires.
</Attribute>
<Attribute field={"token_type"} kind={"string"}>
This field will always be "Bearer"
</Attribute>
</AttributeTable>

### Creating a Service Token in the Dashboard

You can create a service token in the Chalk dashboard by navigating to the "Service Tokens" tab in the "Settings" page.
You can then specify permissions for the token, as well as datasource and feature tags for datasource-based and
feature-based RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), respectively.

### Authenticating a Request Using an Access Token

Use the token obtained from the Client Credentials grant flow in the `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` header
that your client sends along all authenticated requests. For example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.chalk.ai/v1/who-am-i
```

will return a 200 response and a JSON object containing a short description of the requesting user. This is
convenient for verifying that you are using a valid `access_token`.

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

Use service credentials to limit your application's access to specific data sources and features.

### Data sources

For data sources, you can provide an allowlist of tags when creating the service credential. Your service credential
will only be allowed to access data sources whose tags match your allowlist.

### Features

For features, Chalk expects a blocklist or allowlist of tags. Features that are not permissible will be excluded from computation. We
make a distinction between features solely used to compute other features and features which are returned as query
output. You can maintain separate permissions for each of these types of features.

### Examples

If we created a service token blocking the tag `allow1`, then the following features with said tag would not be
computable. If we ran a query with this service token fetching feature `feature1` with tag `allow1`, we would get an
error back indicating that the feature was not accessible:

Feature Definition:
```chalk
@features(tags=["generic"])
class AllowedEvents:
  id: int
  feature1: str = feature(tags=["allow1"])
```
Query:
```chalk
$ chalk query --in allowed_events.id=1 --out allowed_events.feature1

Results:
<query url>

No scalar features

Errors:
Unauthorized allowed_events.feature1

Feature 'allowed_events.feature1' is not authorized for this environment for tag allow1
```
