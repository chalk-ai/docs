Chalk SQL is automatically enabled and available for use in any environment that has at least one
gRPC query server running. Both new and existing environments can start running Chalk SQL queries with extremely
minimal setup.

Chalk SQL queries can be run via the [CLI](/cli?command=sql), via the Python
SDK's [GRPC Client](/api-docs#ChalkGRPCClient.run_sql), or via the SQL Explorer.


## SQL Explorer

The SQL Explorer is an interface built into Chalk's web dashboard, which provides an easy-to-use interface for
making exploratory and experimental queries.

### Database Explorer

The Database Explorer is an overview of the various catalogs, schemas, and tables that Chalk SQL can integrate with.
This catalog of items is determined by your deployment, meaning that it will change as you make deployments to your
environment.

When referencing tables in your queries to Chalk SQL, you must **fully qualify their name**. For example, if you
wish to query the `keys` table in the `online_store` schema within the `chalk` catalog, you should make queries like

```sql
SELECT * FROM chalk.online_store.keys;
```

You can learn more about available tables via the database explorer, or by making queries to Chalk's
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

```sql
-- Example query to find all schemas available in the "chalk" catalog
SELECT * FROM chalk.information_schema.schemas WHERE catalog_name = 'chalk';
```

### Worksheets

Chalk SQL worksheets can be created in the SQL explorer via the Worksheets tab. You can create a "New Sheet" or choose
to use "Save Sheet" on an existing worksheet. Worksheets are tied to users and will be persisted across sessions,
providing an easy way to revisit queries within the explorer.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Queries

Chalk SQL can be run in synchronous and asynchronous modes, which are tailored for transactional and
analytical workloads, respectively. Synchronous queries will hit the GRPC query servers directly, whereas async
queries will create an isolated environment but will take some time to provision.

<TipInfo header="Warning about synchronous queries">
    Running synchronous Chalk SQL queries that are larger in nature can cause gRPC query servers to
    go out-of-memory, which can impact any production traffic running on that engine.
    Clients provide the ability to set memory limits for queries to mitigate this.
