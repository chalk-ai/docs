Chalk SQL is dialect of SQL developed within Chalk built to create **federated queries** across a
Chalk environment. Chalk SQL is a highly efficient, easy-to-write, and expressive language that enable:

- Querying across multiple [SQL sources](/docs/sql) seamlessly
- Introspecting the [online and offline store](/docs/choosing-online-offline-stores), [datasets](/docs/datasets) from
offline queries, and many other entities across the Chalk ecosystem
- Applying functions from the Chalk Function registry in ad-hoc contexts.
- Integrating with existing [online](/docs/query-online) and [offline query](/docs/query-offline) paths
via alternative form of input.

```sql
WITH total_spending AS (
    SELECT
        u.user_id AS user_id,
        SUM(t.amount) AS user_spending,
    FROM "my_postgres.public.user" u  -- Query against a data source named "my_postgres"
    LEFT JOIN "my_bigquery.my_dataset.transactions" t -- Query against a data source named "my_bigquery"
    ON u.user_id = t.user_id
    GROUP BY u.user_id
)
SELECT
    u.user_id AS user_id,
    u.embedding AS user_embedding,
    array_normalize(u.embedding, 2) AS l2_normalized_embedding,
    json_extract(ts.random_transaction_data, '$.timestamp') AS txn_timestamp,
    json_extract(ts.random_transaction_data, '$.metadata.country') AS country,
    ts.user_spending AS user_spending,
FROM "my_postgres.public.users" u
LEFT JOIN total_spending ts
ON u.user_id = ts.user_id
```

Chalk SQL leverages the blazing-fast planning and execution that powers other queries against Chalk,
including features such as [Native SQL drivers](/docs/integrations#sql-data-sources-and-data-warehouses),
[static compilation](/docs/static-resolver-optimization) of expressions, and integration with
[Velox](/docs/architecture#high-performance-execution-engine), the open-source low-latency execution engine. This
makes Chalk SQL a federated query engine that is uniquely effective for both transactional and analytical workloads.
