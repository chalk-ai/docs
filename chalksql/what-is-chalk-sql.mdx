Chalk SQL is dialect of SQL developed within Chalk built to create **federated queries** across a
Chalk environment. Chalk SQL is a highly efficient, easy-to-write, and expressive language that enable:

- Querying across multiple [SQL sources](/docs/sql) seamlessly
- Introspecting the [online and offline store](/docs/choosing-online-offline-stores), [datasets](/docs/datasets) from
offline queries, and many other entities across the Chalk ecosystem
- Applying functions from the Chalk Function registry in ad-hoc contexts.
- Integrating with existing [online](/docs/query-online) and [offline query](/docs/query-offline) paths
via alternative form of input.

Chalk SQL leverages the blazing-fast planning and execution that powers other queries against Chalk,
including features such as [Native SQL drivers](/docs/integrations#sql-data-sources-and-data-warehouses),
[static compilation](/docs/static-resolver-optimization) of expressions, and integration with
[Velox](/docs/architecture#high-performance-execution-engine), the open-source low-latency execution engine. This
makes Chalk SQL a federated query engine that is uniquely effective for both transactional and analytical workloads.

## How do I run Chalk SQL queries?

Chalk SQL is automatically enabled and available for use in any environment that has at least one
gRPC query server running. Both new and existing environments can start running Chalk SQL queries with extremely
minimal setup.
