## Overview

Chalk uses two main timestamps you should be aware of as you build your Chalk project:

1. Feature time (`FeatureTime`): The time at which a feature was observed, which is used in query time filters and
aggregation time windows.
2. Query time (`Now`): The time a query should assume is "now" when retrieving data. Features whose feature time comes
after a given query time will never be returned for those queries, in online or offline contexts.

Feature time is returned in the `__observed_at__` column in Chalk query results. Query time is returned in the `__ts__`
column.

## Feature time

Feature time is the time at which a feature was observed. By default, Chalk sets a feature's time to the feature's
resolver execution time. The feature time can be overridden for a feature class, accessed from resolver parameters, and
requested in query inputs and outputs.

You may have multiple timestamps associated with your data. It's important to set the feature time to the value that
most closely represents when your system would have accessed the data in production.

For example, in an asynchronous streaming system, you may have one timestamp for when an event was added to your task
queue and another timestamp for when the event was removed from the queue and processed. We recommend using the
latter timestamp as your feature time to make your training most closely resemble production. If you use the timestamp
for when an event was added to your task queue, you would be training your system with data it would not have been able
to access in production.

### Setting feature time for a feature class

Each individual feature has its own feature time, which is used to retrieve point-in-time correct data for [temporal
consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency).

To access the latest time associated with any feature in a feature class, use the special `FeatureTime` feature
throughout Chalk.

By default, if it is present, Chalk will treat a feature named `ts` with `datetime.datetime` type as the `FeatureTime`
value. Otherwise, you can use the `FeatureTime` type annotation to set a different name:

```py
from chalk.features import features, FeatureTime

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    timestamp: FeatureTime  # datetime.datetime under the hood
```

Using your `FeatureTime` feature, you can access and override feature time for the whole feature class.

You can access the `FeatureTime` as a resolver input. In this example, `ts` will be set to the maximum feature time for
all features passed as resolver parameters:

```py
@offline
def fn(name: User.name, ts: User.timestamp) -> ...:
```

You can directly set the `FeatureTime` value by returning it from a resolver:

```py
@offline
def fn(...) -> Features[User.name, User.timestamp]:
    return User(
        name="Maryam Mirzakhani",
        ts=datetime(2014, 8, 12, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    )
```

You can include the `FeatureTime` feature in query [`output`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.output). Its value
will be set to the maximum timestamp across all features in its feature class.

### Time filtering in resolvers

[has-many](/docs/has-many) features create [DataFrames](/docs/dataframe). These DataFrames can be filtered with
[`before`](/api-docs#before) and [`after`](/api-docs#after).

Regardless of which time filters you use, Chalk will never return features where the feature time is strictly greater
than the current query time (`Now`), in order to maintain [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency).

#### Examples

To compute the number of transfers a user made in the last seven days, use [`after`](/api-docs#after):

```py
from chalk.features import after, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[after(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```

To compute the number of transfers a user made *more than* seven days ago, use [`before`](/api-docs#before):

```py
from chalk.features import before, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[before(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```

Combine `before` and `after` to retrieve transfers made 1-2 weeks ago:

```py
from chalk.features import before, after, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[after(days_ago=14), before(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```

All of these examples can be used in combination with [other DataFrame projections and
filters](/docs/dataframe#composing-projections-and-filters). You may also find [windowed
aggregations](/docs/aggregations) useful.

### Interaction with the online store

Features with overriden observation timestamps are treated specially when inserted into the online store.
In particular, Chalk will always check for existing "newer" feature values in the online store
before inserting historically dated feature values. This means that you can safely ingest large quantities
of backdated features without accidentally ingesting stale data into the online store.

Additionally, once features are inserted into the online store, Chalk tracks the source observation timestamps
when these feature values are returned as part of online queries. Chalk uses these source timestamps
to compute the "feature staleness" metric. Staleness in this context is defined as "query time - observation time".

### Interaction with the offline store

Features with overriden observation timestamps are inserted into the offline store with the timestamp that you
specify. The observation timestamp works like an "effective as of" timestamp, so if you insert something like this:

```
| id | feature | value | timestamp            |
|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | age     | 7     | 2022-02-01T00:00:00Z |
```

into an offline store that already contained these observations:

```
| id | feature | value | timestamp            |
|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | age     | 6     | 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z |
| 1  | age     | 8     | 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z |
```

then the observation will be interleaved "in between" the existing observations, and you would see the following query
results:

```
id, age, <= 2022-02-01
output: 7

id, age, <= 2022-03-02
output: 8

id, age, <= 2022-01-02
output: 6
```

### Enforcing a TTL

Features in the offline store have an optional TTL (time to live). When a feature has a TTL value, it will never be
returned at any time later than `FeatureTime` + TTL. For example, you may not want to consider credit scores which were
retrieved more than a year ago. Setting [`offline_ttl`](/api-docs#feature.offline_ttl) will make `credit_score` return
None if last observed credit score is more than one year old in comparison to the current query time.

```py
@features
class User:
    id: str
    credit_score: int = feature(offline_ttl=timedelta(years=1))
```

---

## Query time

Query time is the time treated as "now" within a query context. For online queries, `Now` is equal to `datetime.now()`.
For offline queries, you can pass one or more timestamps that will be used as the query time for each input row.

### Setting query time

In training, you will likely want to retrieve data as if you are at a point in the past to create the most accurate
predictions. We cover this idea in greater detail in our [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency)
documentation.

To set the query's "now" time, pass [`input_times`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input_times) as either a single
timestamp or as a list corresponding to the `Now` times to use for each entry in `input`:

```py
from datetime import timezone

ChalkClient().offline_query(
    # Pass id 1 multiple times because we want to
    # request it with multiple input_times
    input={User.id: [1, 1, 1]},  
    input_times=[
        datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=365 * 10),
        datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=365),
        datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=0),
    ],
    output=[User.age_in_years],
)

## Output:

# | id | age_in_years |
# | 1  | <age> - 10   |
# | 1  | <age> - 1    |
# | 1  | <age> - 0    |
```

### Accessing query time in resolvers

To access the query time in your resolvers, you can reference a special feature called `Now`, which is a
`datetime.datetime` object.

You can pass `Now` in Python resolvers:

```py
from chalk import Now

@online
def get_age_in_years(birthday: User.birthday, now: Now) -> User.age_in_years:
    return (now - birthday).years
```

`Now` can be used in DataFrame resolvers as well in order to compute bulk values:

```py
@online
def batch_get_age_in_years(df: DataFrame[User.id, User.birthday, Now]) -> DataFrame[User.id, User.age_in_years]:
    return (
        df.to_polars()
            .select(
                pl.col(User.id),
                pl.col(str(User.birthday) - pl.col(str(Now))).alias(str(User.age_in_years))
            )
    )
```

You can also reference `${now}` in SQL file resolvers. If `Now` is used in a resolver to compute a has-many join, then
the `Now` feature must be passed as input.

```sql
-- source: sql_file_resolver_temp_db
-- resolves: tv_episode
select id,
       name,
       season_no,
       episode_no,
       show_name,
       air_date
from tv_episodes
where air_date < ${now}
  and id = ${tv_episode.id}
```

### Accessing query time in query results

Chalk [Datasets](/docs/datasets) return the query time in the `__ts__` column.

When converting Chalk Datasets to Polars or Pandas DataFrames, you may want to include the query time column. To do so,
pass `output_ts` to your [`to_polars`](/api-docs#Dataset.to_polars) or [`to_pandas`](/api-docs#Dataset.to_pandas) calls.
You may pass a column name to `output_ts` to set the name of the query time column. If you pass `True`, the query time
column name will be `__chalk__.CHALK_TS`.

<TipInfo>
Be careful to not mix up <code>__ts__</code> and <code>ts</code>. <code>__ts__</code> represents the query time, or the
time the query treats as "now" during query execution. <code>ts</code> is a common name for the feature representing
<code>FeatureTime</code>, the time at which a feature was observed.
</TipInfo>


## Timezone handling for naive datetimes
Chalk stores UTC as the timezone for naive datetime objects. Additionally, Chalk assumes UTC if retrieving naive
datetimes from data stores.

We recommend that you include timezone information on all datetime objects you work with to avoid ambiguity.
