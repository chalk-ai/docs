## Overview

Your Chalk project's configuration is shared across the following files:

1. `chalk.yaml` (or `chalk.yml`): Configuration for your project's deployment
2. `.chalkignore`: Files to exclude from your project's deployment
3. A requirements file: Default Python requirements for Chalk to install via `pip` (can be overridden in `chalk.yaml`).
This can either be `requirements.txt` or a `pyproject.toml`
(via [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)).

Here's our recommended repository structure:

```
company_chalk/
├── src/
│  ├── resolvers/
│  │  ├── ...
│  │  ├── __init__.py
│  │  └── pipelines.py
│  ├── __init__.py
│  ├── datasources.py
│  └── feature_sets.py
├── tests/
│  └── ...
├── notebooks/
│  └── ...
├── .chalkignore
├── chalk.yaml
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

When you're first getting started, we recommend putting all your features in a single
file. Keeping the features in a single file makes circular references easier to reason
about, as they can just be quoted.

If you do want to split your features across multiple files,
you'll need to use the `if TYPE_CHECKING` block from the `typing` module.

### Organizing Feature Definitions Across Files

In large projects, it's common to split feature definitions across multiple Python modules.
For unidirectional dependencies, this is straightforward. For example, if `src/models/user.py` imports
`src/models/profile.py`, you can define the `User` and `Profile` features in separate files without
issues. However, if you have circular dependencies, you may run into problems.

Chalk supports this, but circular imports can arise when features reference each other across files.
To avoid these issues, use the `if TYPE_CHECKING` block from the `typing` module and quote your forward references.

Here's an example of how to do this cleanly:

```python src/models/profile.py
# Imports `User` directly, because `src/models/user.py`
# doesn't import `src/models/profile.py`
from chalk.features import features
from src.models.user import User

@features
class Profile:
    id: Primary[User.id]
    username: str
```

```python src/models/user.py
from chalk.features import features
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Imports `Profile` only when type checking
    # to avoid circular imports
    from src.models.profile import Profile

@features
class User:
    id: str
    # Profile must be quoted because it is imported
    # only when type checking
    profile: "Profile"
```

By quoting imports inside `if TYPE_CHECKING`,
you avoid circular dependency errors while still
maintaining type safety and feature linkage.

If the relationship to `Profile` is optional, you can use `typing.Optional` or the `| None` syntax,
but the _entire_ annotation should be quoted:

```python src/models/user.py
from chalk.features import features
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from src.models.profile import Profile

@features
class User:
    id: str
    # All of `"Profile | None"` must be quoted, not just the `Profile` part
    profile: "Profile | None"
```

A similar pattern should be used for `DataFrame` annotations:

```python src/models/user.py
from chalk.features import features
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from src.models.profile import Profile

@features
class User:
    id: str
    # All of `"DataFrame[Transaction]"` must be quoted, not just the `Transaction` part
    transactions: "DataFrame[Transaction]"
```

In a project with features living in different files, we recommend that the schema definition
all live in a single folder, separate from the resolvers. In this case, your folder structure
will look something like:

```
company_chalk/
├── src/
│  ├── models/
│  │  ├── user.py
│  │  ├── profile.py
│  │  ├── __init__.py
│  │  └── ...
│  ├── resolvers/
│  │  ├── ...
│  │  ├── __init__.py
│  │  └── pipelines.py
│  ├── __init__.py
│  ├── datasources.py
│  └── feature_sets.py
├── tests/
│  └── ...
├── notebooks/
│  └── ...
├── .chalkignore
├── chalk.yaml
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Keeping the schema definition all in one place (as you might with something like Protobuf or Avro files)
helps you keep your schema definitions organized and makes importing them in your resolvers straightforward.

## chalk.yaml

Use `chalk.yaml` to configure your project's Docker environment, Python configuration, and metadata validation for your
features and resolvers.

### Sample file

Here is a sample `chalk.yaml` file. In this file, we use a different Dockerfile in production.

```yaml
project: my-project-id

environments:
  default:
    runtime: python312
    requirements: requirements.txt
  prod:
    dockerfile: ./DockerfileProd

validation:
  feature:
    metadata:
      - name: owner
        missing: error
      - name: description
        missing: warning
      - name: tags
        missing: info
  resolver:
    metadata:
      - name: owner
        missing: error
```

---

## .chalkignore
Your `.chalkignore` file should include your scripts, notebooks, and tests. Anything that you are not actively using in
your deployment should be added so that non-deployment code does not clutter or interfere with your deployment.

---

## Python Requirements

Chalk will install the Python requirements for your project as specified in the `requirements`
parameter of your `chalk.yaml` file. This can either be a `requirements.txt` file or a `pyproject.toml`.
Chalk supports both `Poetry` and `uv` for managing your Python dependencies.
You can specify this file's location and type in your `chalk.yaml` file like below:

```yaml
project: my-project-id

environments:
  dev:
    runtime: python312
    requirements: requirements-dev.txt
  prod:
    requirements: pyproject.yaml
```

### Python Requirement Overrides

The requirements file specified in your `chalk.yaml` file will serve as the default dependency set for
your environment. However, if you have different requirements for specific resolvers, you can also
define alternative virtual environments under the `venvs` key in your `chalk.yaml` file.

```yaml
project: features

environments:
    default:
        runtime: python311
        requirements: ./requirements.txt
        platform_version: v3.26.8

venvs:
    model-1:
      dependencies:
        - numpy==2.3.2
        - pandas==2.3.2
        - scikit-learn==1.7.2
        - tensorflow==2.20.0
        - torch
        - transformers
    model-2:
      requirements: ./requirements-model-2.txt
```

For each virtual environment, you can specify the associated dependencies either by passing in a list of Python
requirements under the `dependencies` key, or by providing a filepath to a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
file under the `requirements` key.

Then, to run a specific resolver in one of these virtual environments, you can reference your virtual environment
using the name specified in your `chalk.yaml` file in the `@before_all`, `@online`, and `@offline` decorators.
For your `@before_all` functions, if there is no `venv` specified, the function will run in every
virtual environment. Otherwise, if there is a `venv` specified, the function will only run in the specified
virtual environment. Otherwise, `@online` and `@offline` resolvers will default to run using the default virtual
environment, unless a different `venv` is specified.

```python
from chalk import before_all, online, offline, Features
from src.models import User

# this will run in all venvs
@before_all()
def before_all_hook():
    from services import msvc

    msvc_client = msvc.Client()

# runs **only** in specified venv
@before_all(venv="model-1")
def before_all_model_1():
    from models import Model1

    model_1 = Model1.load()

# runs **only** in specified venv
@before_all(venv="model-2")
def before_all_model_2():
    from models import Model2

    model_2 = Model2.load()

# runs using default venv
@online
def get_user_email_domain(
    email: User.email
) -> Features[User.email_handle, User.email_domain]:
    handle, domain = email.split("@")
    return User(email_handle=handle, email_domain=domain)

# runs using model-1 venv
@online(venv="model-1")
def get_user_risk_score_1(
    id: User.id,
    email_domain: User.email_domain,
    recent_activity_count: User.recent_activity_count["7d"]
) ->User.is_fraud_1:
    threshold = msvc_client.get_model_threshold("model-1")
    return model_1.predict(id, email_domain, recent_activity_count).sum() > threshold

# runs using model-2 venv
@online(venv="model-2")
def get_user_risk_score_2(
    id: User.id,
    email_domain: User.email_domain,
    recent_activity_count: User.recent_activity_count["7d"]
) -> User.is_fraud_2:
    threshold = msvc_client.get_model_threshold("model-2")
    return model_2.predict(id, email_domain, recent_activity_count).sum() > threshold
```

## Pinning Chalk Platform Versions

By default, when you deploy in your Chalk environment, Chalk will pull the latest version of the Chalk platform.
You can choose to pin a [Chalk platform version](/release-notes)  for each environment such that your deployments
will only update your Chalk code, and will use the same platform image until you deploy a new pinned platform
version.

```yaml
project: my-project-id
environments:
  dev:
    runtime: python312
    requirements: requirements-dev.txt
    platform_version: v3.27.30
  staging:
    runtime: python312
    requirements: requirements-staging.txt
    platform_version: v3.27.30
  prod:
    runtime: python312
    requirements: requirements.txt
    platform_version: v3.27.30
```
