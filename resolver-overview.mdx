description: Create resolvers to compute feature values.

---

Resolvers define how to compute your feature values.
Resolvers [take as input](/docs/resolver-inputs)
features that they need to know to run, and
[resolve the values](/docs/resolver-outputs)
of one or more features.
In both cases, you use
[Python type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
to define these dependencies and outputs.

Resolvers run [online or offline](/docs/resolver-online-offline)
and are declared with the decorators `@online` and `@offline`.
Let's take a look at a resolver that computes whether
a user is titled on a bank account:

```py
from chalk import online

@online
def name_match(
    name: User.full_name,
    account_name: User.bank_account.title
) -> User.account_name_match_score:
    if name.lower() == account_name.lower():
        return 1.
    return 0.
```

This resolver has _dependencies_ on `User.full_name`
and `User.bank_account.title`. It _resolves_ the feature
value `User.account_name_match_score`.
The logic for resolving this function is given in the body
of the function definition.

## What to read next

Resolvers support many workflows and common orchestration patterns:

- **[Environments](/docs/resolver-environments)** -
  Swap out the functionality of a resolver in development, staging, or production.
- **[Tags](/docs/resolver-tags)** -
  Provide custom functionality within an environment based on tags.
- **[Scheduled runs](/docs/resolver-cron)** -
  Schedule periodic runs of resolvers.
- **[Reverse ETL](/docs/reverse-etl)** -
  Move features from your data warehouses to production.
