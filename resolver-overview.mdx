While feature sets define what your data looks like (e.g. the types of your features,
their relationships, and their properties), resolvers define how your feature values
are computed.

<TipInfo>
if you haven't read the section on feature sets, you are strongly encourage to do so. Understanding feature sets will help you understand resolvers.
</TipInfo>

Resolvers have four main components: inputs, outputs, code, and run conditions.

The first three of these are rather straightforward. The **inputs** to a resolver
are the features it uses to compute its output. The **outputs** of a resolver
are the features that it computes. The code of the resolver is the logic that
transforms your input features into your output features.

The last component, run conditions, is a little more nuanced. At a high level,
Chalk is optimized for two different access patterns: online and offline. In online
access, information about a single entity is being requested and features must be
computed quickly and cached. In offline access, a large chunk of historical
feature data is being requested (you can think of this as creating a dataset for model
training or running an analytic query).

Resolvers are always specified as either online or offline. We go into more detail
about what this means in the [next section where we talk about run conditions](/docs/resolver-online-offline),
but for now it is important to note that: 1). every resolver is either online or offline, and 2). different
resolvers run depending on how you are requesting data from Chalk.

## Writing Resolvers

Chalk allows you to write resolvers in three different ways:
- as sql queries, with comments specifying data sources and output features,
- as python functions, with type annotations specifying the input and output features,
- inline in your feature definitions, with the underscore module.

<TipInfo>
You will likely write mostly python and sql resolvers, so most of our examples
will be for these two variants. However, underscore resolvers are a succint and
optimized way to write resolvers, which can be quite practical in certain cases.
We will cover them at the end of the resolver section.

## A Quick Example

Below, we provide an example of how to write SQL and python resolvers in Chalk
for a `User` feature set. In this example, we assume that a Postgres data source
called `pg_users` has been configured and connected to Chalk.

First, let's define our `User` feature set:

```python src/user.py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
  id: str
  name: str
  age: int
  hobbies: list[str]

  is_runner: bool  # computed feature
```

Now we define our resolvers:

We resolve the `id`, `name`, `age`, and `hobbies` features for our users from the
`users` table of a `pg_users` data source. When reading data from your data
sources, you should use a sql resolver:

```sql src/get_user.chalk.sql
-- The features given to us by the user.
-- resolves: user
-- type: online
-- source: pg_users
select id, name, age, hobbies
from users;
```

We now use a python resolver to compute the `is_runner` feature for our users.
Is runner takes the `hobbies` feature as an input and computes a new feature:
`is_runner`.

```python
from chalk import online

@online
def get_is_runner(
    name: User.hobbies
) -> User.account_name_match_score:
    return "runner" in hobbies
```

## When Do Resolvers Run

A question that often crops up at this point, is: ok, I have defined a resolver, but how do
I make it run?

Just like features, the idea behind resolvers is that they are declarative. Resolvers
don't run when you define them and they don't run exhaustively over your data. They run
only in response to a request for the features that they are responsible for computing. In
practice, this means that they run in response to "queries".

A query is just a request for data. Chalk takes a query and determines which resolvers it
needs to run, optimizes the execution order, and provides you with a response. For now, we'll
hold off on discussing queries further, but definitely feel free to skip ahead and
get a sense of [what Chalk queries are and how they work](/docs/query-basics), before diving
deeper into resolvers.
