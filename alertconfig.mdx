Connect your [Alert Thresholds](/docs/metricmonitor#add-alert-trigger) to external alerting tools like [PagerDuty](/docs/pagerduty) and [Slack](/docs/slack).

---

## Configure your alerts

Visit Settings > Alert Configuration to connect an "owner" to a "channel". All alerts that belong to that owner (as configured on the alert trigger), will be sent to this channel.
One owner can have alerts sent to many channels. Edit or remove the alert configuration, or send a test message, using the buttons on the right hand side.
