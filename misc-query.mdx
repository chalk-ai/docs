## Interaction

### Online-to-Offline

After an online resolver runs, its values are copied into the [offline store](#storage).
When you [query the offline store](/docs/training-client),
you will receive data from both records of online runs and offline-specific resolvers.
Which data you receive depends on which data was closest to the point-in-time
that you queried.
For more information, see [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency).

### Offline-to-online

In contrast, data from the offline environment _does not_
reach the online store by default.
However, you can choose to ETL the data from an offline
resolver into the online store.
This can be helpful, for example,
when you tolerate stale data in online inference and
have a data source in the offline environment that doesn't
have a direct replacement in the online environment.
More details are provided in the section [Reverse ETL](/docs/reverse-etl).

Tags allow you to scope requests within an environment.
Both tags and environment need to match for a resolver to
be a candidate to execute.

You might consider using tags, for example, to change out
whether you want to use a sandbox environment for a vendor,
or to bypass the vendor and return constant values in a
