Offline queries can consume significant amounts of system resources. Chalk's management plane checks each
running offline query every 60 seconds to verify that the query is still running. If the query has not
updated its heartbeat within the last 60 seconds, the query is considered to have timed out and is killed.

Typically, this is due to the query being too resource-intensive for the system to handle. If you are experiencing
offline query timeouts, you may want to consider the following:

0. **Check for out-of-memory errors**: Check the 'metrics' tab of your query, and look at the reported memory utilization.
    If you are running out of memory, you may want to increase the memory requests for your
   offline query pods. You can do this by navigating to the "Resources" page in the Chalk UI and increasing the memory
   requests for offline query workers.
1. **Use `run_asynchronously`**: Add `run_asynchronously=True` to isolate your query to its own kubernetes pod. This
    lowers the chance that your query will contend with other workloads on a single machine and may help prevent timeouts.
2. **Adjust node selectors**: If you are using node selectors to run your offline queries on specific nodes, ensure that
    the nodes you are selecting have enough resources to handle the query. Make sure that your workloads are not co-scheduled
    with other intense tasks.
3. **Shard your query**: If you are running a large query, consider breaking it into smaller pieces using `num_shards`.
    This can help prevent timeouts and improve the overall performance of your query.
4. **Optimize your query**: Look at the operations the query is processing. Check for Python resolvers that
    use heavy libraries, or that perform memory-intensive operations like Pandas transformations.

If you are still experiencing timeouts, contact Chalk Support for further assistance. Please provide an example
failed query and context on how to reproduce the issue.
