# OpenTelemetry Metrics & Traces

Chalk provides a simple way to collect metrics and traces from your applications using OpenTelemetry. This guide
assumes that you have deployed the OpenTelemetry Collector in your cluster. If you haven't done so, please do that first.

Chalk respects standard OTLP environment variables for configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector.

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint to send OTLP data to. This can be a URL or a Unix domain socket.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint to send OTLP traces and metrics to. If not set, the value of `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is used.


In Kubernetes, you will probably want to set values that look like this:

```yaml
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: http://xray-collector-service.your-collector-namespace:4317
```
  
where `xray-collector-service` is the name of the service that exposes the OpenTelemetry Collector, 
and `your-collector-namespace` is the namespace where the collector is deployed. You can set these values using
Settings -> Variables, or Settings -> Resources.
