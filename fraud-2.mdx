*If you want to skip ahead, you can find the full source code for this tutorial on
[GitHub](https://github.com/chalk-ai/fraud-example).*

In this example, we'll consider a fintech use-case
where we want to detect fraudulent credit card purchases.
Our data consists of a list of credit card transactions,
each with a timestamp, a location, and a purchase amount.
We also have information about the cardholder and the
accounts that the card is linked to.

## Define features

We'll start by modeling the features we want for our
the users in our system.
We'll start simple with three
[scalar features](/docs/feature-types):
`user.id`, `user.name`, and `user.email`.
First, we'll create a new file called [`models.py`](https://github.com/chalk-ai/fraud-example/blob/main/src/models.py)
where we'll define a `User` class decorated with
[`@features`](/api-docs#features).

```python src/user.py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int

    # The name the user provided to us at signup.
    # :owner: identity@chalk.ai
    # :tags: pii
    name: str

    # :tags: pii
    email: str
```

Note that at this point,
we haven't defined how to compute these
features. We are only thinking about the data
that we would like to have.

### Primary keys

There are a few things to note here. First, all our feature
classes need to have a unique `id` field. By default, this
is the field named `id`. However, if you want to use a
different field as the primary key, you can specify it
using the `Primary` argument to `@features`.

```diff-py src/user.py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
-   id: int
+   user_id: Primary[int]
    name: str
    email: str
```

### Tags, Descriptions, & Owners

In our features below, we've added some comments and
annotations to our features. These are optional, but
can be useful for documentation and for setting alerting
policies. For example, you may wish to send [Pagerduty alerts](/docs/pagerduty)
to [different teams](/docs/alertconfig) based on
the owner of the related feature.

Any of the comments and tags from the code also show up
in the [Chalk dashboard](https://chalk.ai/projects),
and are indexed for search.

For example, we've added a `pii` tag
to the `name` and `email` fields. This means that
these fields will be treated as personally identifiable
information and will be subject to additional
restrictions.

---

## Has-One Relationships

Next up, we'll define a related feature class to our users.
We'll call this class `Account` and it will represent
a bank account that a user owns.

```python src/models.py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class Account:
    id: int

    # The name of the owner of the account.
    title: str

    # The id of the user that owns this account.
    user_id: int

    # The balance of the account, in dollars.
    balance: float
```

This should look much like what we did for the `User` class.
However, we may want to link these two classes together.
We can do this by adding a `user` field to the `Account` class.

```diff-py src/models.py
@features
class Account:
    id: int
-   user_id: int
+   user_id: User.id
    balance: float

+   # The user that owns this account.
+   user: User
```

This denotes that each account has one user, and that the
`Account.user_id` and the `User.id` are equal and of type `int`, as described by `Account.user_id`.

Once we've defined the relationship on one side of the
join, we can define the inverse relationship on the
other side without needing to specify the predicate
again.

```diff-py src/models.py
@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

+   # The account that this user owns.
+   account: "Account"
```

---

## Has-Many Relationships

The final feature entity that we'll define in this tutorial is
for transactions. Each account has many transactions, and each
transaction is linked to a single account. We'll define the
`Transaction` class and link it to our `Account` class as follows:

```diff-py src/models.py
- from chalk.features import features
+ from chalk.features import features, DataFrame

+ class TransactionStatus(str, Enum):
+     PENDING = "pending"
+     CLEARED = "cleared"
+     FAILED = "failed"
+
+ @features
+ class Transaction:
+    id: int
+
+    # The id of the account that this transaction belongs to, set to a join.
+    account_id: "Account.id"
+
+    # The amount of the transaction, in dollars.
+    amount: float
+
+    # The status of the transaction, defined as an enum above.
+    status: TransactionStatus
+
+    # Because we define the join condition between
+    # `Transaction` and `Account` below, we don't
+    # need to repeat it here.
+    account: "Account"

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

    # The account that this user owns.
    account: "Account"

@features
class Account:
    id: int
    user_id: User.id
    balance: float
    user: User
+   transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
```

This is the first time we're seeing the [`DataFrame`](/docs/dataframe) type.

A Chalk `DataFrame` models tabular data in much the same
way that `pandas` does. However, there are some key differences that
allow the Chalk `DataFrame` to increase type safety and performance.

Like pandas, Chalk's `DataFrame` is a two-dimensional data structure with
rows and columns. You can perform operations like filtering, grouping,
and aggregating on a `DataFrame`. However, there are two main differences.

- *Lazy implementation* - Chalk's `DataFrame` is lazy and can be backed by multiple data sources, where a `pandas.DataFrame` executes eagerly in memory.
- *Use as a type* - Chalk's `DataFrame[...]` can be used to represent a type of data with pre-defined filters.

You can read more about the Chalk `DataFrame`
in the [docs](/docs/dataframe) and
[API Reference](/api-docs#DataFrame).

You might also notice that we've used an [`Enum`](/docs/feature-types#scalars) feature here.
Chalk supports many feature types, including
[`Enum`](/docs/feature-types#scalars),
[lists and sets](/docs/feature-types#lists-and-sets),
and [`@dataclasses`](/docs/feature-types#dataclass).
