## Introduction

Chalk offers a hosted model ("Chalk Cloud") and
a customer-hosted model ("Customer Cloud").
Most companies choose to run Chalk in their own
cloud using the Customer Cloud model.
This page discusses the Customer Cloud deployment
of Chalk on AWS and GCP.

A Chalk deployment consists of a Metadata Plane and one or more Data Planes:

<ServiceDiagramSwitcher default_option={"AWS"} />

This guide will walk through deploying a Chalk instance
in your cloud environment using [Helm](https://helm.sh/),
an open-source package manager for Kubernetes.

## Installing the Required Client Software

This guide requires a few pieces of software to be installed on your machine.

1. First, begin by installing [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
2. Then, make sure you have installed the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for AWS, or the [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for GCP.
3. Next, install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
4. Finally, ensure that you are able to authenticate to your Kubernetes cluster and run `helm list` to verify that `helm` is installed.

## Configuring your Cloud Environment

Before you can deploy Chalk, you will need to configure
your cloud environment to support the deployment. Work
with your Chalk support team to create the following components:

- A Kubernetes cluster in your cloud environment, configured with storage, networking, and relevant CRDs
- Namespaces in your Kubernetes cluster for Chalk
- IAM principals for your Chalk management plane
- IAM principals for your Chalk workloads
- Storage buckets
- Online storage components
- AWS SNS/SQS or Google PubSub for asynchronous processing

---

## Authenticating to the Chalk Private Helm Registry

Next, authenticate to the Chalk Private Helm Registry so that you can access Chalk Helm charts.

1. Provide your AWS Account ID or Google Project ID to your Chalk representative. IAM principals in your
account will be granted permission to access Chalk's private registries.
2. Authenticate to the Chalk registry:

To authenticate in AWS using an IAM role, run the following command:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | helm registry login --username AWS --password-stdin 754784422779.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

For GCP, please configure your `gcloud` cli by following the [Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/helm/authentication)
with the following location:

```bash
us-docker.pkg.dev
```

To verify that you are properly authenticated, you can perform a dry run of templating the Chalk Metadata Plane Helm chart.
This command will print an error, because we have not configured
important values for this chart, but this failure indicates
that you are properly fetching the chart and attempting to render it.

To check on AWS, run:

```bash
helm template chalk-metadata-plane oci://754784422779.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/charts/chalk-metadata-plane
```

on GCP, run:

```bash
helm template chalk-metadata-plane oci://us-docker.pkg.dev/chalk-prod/charts/chalk-metadata-plane
```

These commands will fail with a message like this:

```bash
Pulled: 754784422779.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/charts/chalk-metadata-plane:0.1.2
Digest: sha256:15774ef462c772af0496e1af768529e13503c5b7a5513b5a4d2f75359bddc7ea
Error: execution error at (chalk-metadata-plane/templates/frontend/deployment.yaml:2:4): Value chalk.metadata.frontend.image is required
```

This error is expected, as we have not yet configured the chart. If you see this error, you are ready to proceed.

## Configuring your values file

Next, we will configure the values file for the Chalk Metadata Plane.
This file will contain all the necessary configuration for your Chalk deployment.

1. Create a new file called `values.yaml` and copy the following contents into it:

```yaml
chalk:
  metadata:
    # Your API host. Chalk's default host is api.chalk.ai,
    # but you will need to configure one for your instance.
    api_host: <YOUR API HOST, e.g. https://api.chalk.ai>
    # Your frontend host. Chalk's default host is chalk.ai,
    # but you will need to configure one for your instance.
    frontend_host: <YOUR FRONTEND HOST, e.g. https://chalk.ai>
    api_server:
      metric_check_pull_subscription: foo
      metric_check_trigger_topic: foo
    frontend:
      image: <YOUR FRONTEND IMAGE>
```

*Note*: `<YOUR FRONTEND IMAGE>` will be provided by Chalk.

---

## Configuring your database seeding

Next, we will configure the database seeding for the Chalk Metadata Plane. This file contains
the team, project, and environment configuration, and initial users for your Chalk deployment.

1. Create a new file called `seed.yaml` and copy the following contents into it:

```yaml
chalk:
  metadata:
    seed:
      teams:
        # lowercase, less than 10 characters, no spaces or special characters.
        - id: teamshortid
          name: Your Company Name
      projects:
        # lowercase, less than 10 characters, no spaces or special characters.
        - id: projectshortid
          name: Your Project Name
          team_id: teamshortid
      environments:
        # lowercase, less than 10 characters, no spaces or special characters.
        - id: envshortid
          name: Development
          project_id: projectshortid
          team_id: teamshortid
      team_invites:
        - id: "seed_invite_1"
          team: teamshortid
          email: "your@email.com"
          role: owner
```

## Configuring Google OIDC

Chalk supports various forms of SSO -- OIDC, SAML, and others. For this guide, we will configure Google OIDC.

Create a file named `oidc.env`, and add the following contents. Do not check this file in:

```yaml
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECREET
```

Then, create a Kubernetes secret with this file:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic chalk-frontend-secrets \
  --namespace YOUR_METADATA_PLANE_KUBE_NAMESPACE \
  --from-env-file frontend-secrets.env
```

---

## Deploying the Chalk Metadata Plane

Now that you have configured your values file and your database seeding, you can deploy the Chalk Metadata Plane.

```bash
helm install chalk-metadata-plane oci://317932201237.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/charts/chalk-metadata-plane \
  --namespace YOUR_METADATA_PLANE_KUBE_NAMESPACE \
  --values values.yaml \
  --values seed.yaml
```

### Verifying the installation

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n YOUR_METADATA_PLANE_KUBE_NAMESPACE
```

You should see pods starting up in your namespace. If you see any errors, you can run `kubectl describe pod <podname>`
to get more information.

Once your pods are started, visit the `frontend_host` you configured in your `values.yaml` file to see the Chalk
frontend. You should be able to log in.

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed the Chalk Metadata Plane, you can [configure your local environment](https://docs.chalk.ai/docs/setup-guide)
to interact with your Chalk instance.
