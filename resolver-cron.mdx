You can schedule resolvers to run on a pre-determined schedule
via the `cron` argument to resolver decorators.

```py
@online(cron="**90d**")
def fn() -> DataFrame[User.id, User.name]:
    return ...
```

The `cron` keyword arguments takes a [duration](/docs/duration)
to determine the schedule on which to run. For more fine-grained control,
you can alternatively specify a [crontab](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html).

```py
@online(cron="***/5 * * * ***")
def region_average(
    houses: DataFrame[
        House.city, House.rent_price
    ]
) -> DataFrame[Region.name, Region.average_price]:
    return houses.group_by(
        group={Region.name: House.city},
        agg={
            Region.average_price: op.mean(House.rent_price),
        },
    )
```

## Scheduling with arguments

Scheduled resolvers can also take arguments.
Chalk gives you control over which arguments should be
provided for each run of the schedule.

### All examples (default)

Chalk calls the resolver with
all unique argument names that could have called the function.
Consider a scheduled resolver that takes in
`Feature 1` and `Feature 2`:

<ScheduleSampling />

In this example, we compute two points to sample:
(1, 5) and (1, 7). These two values will be given
to the resolver on the specified cron schedule.

### Filtering examples

You can choose to filter down the set of all examples to run.
The `cron` keyword argument alternatively takes a `Cron` class.
By specifying a function from features to boolean,
you can tell Chalk which of the [default examples](#all-examples-default)
to run, and which to skip:

```py
def filter_examples(bank_id: User.bank_account.balance) -> bool:
    return balance > 100

@online(cron=Cron(schedule="1d", filter=filter_examples))
def fn(balance: User.bank_account.balance) -> ...:
```

The arguments to the filter function all need to be rooted in the
same entity as the features in the scheduled resolver,
but there is no requirement that the filter function take a subset
of the scheduled resolver's arguments:

```py
def filter_examples(status: User.bank_account.status) -> bool:
    return status == "opened"

@online(cron=Cron(schedule="1d", filter=filter_examples))
def fn(balance: User.bank_account.balance) -> ...:
```

### Custom examples

Finally, you can pick exactly the examples that you'd like to run.

```py
def pull_examples() -> DataFrame[User.id]:
    return DataFrame.read_csv(...)

@online(cron=Cron(schedule="1d", samples=pull_examples))
def fn(uid: User.id) -> ...:
```

In the above example, we provide all arguments to the resolver function.
However, you may also choose to provide only a subset of the arguments,
and Chalk will sample the other arguments.

```py
def pull_examples() -> DataFrame[User.id]:
    return DataFrame.read_csv(...)

@online(cron=Cron(schedule="1d", samples=pull_examples))
def fn(uid: User.id, balance: User.account.balance) -> ...:
```
