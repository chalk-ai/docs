Chalk is composed of an online and an offline store. The online store is a cache used to make
realtime requests for data incredibly fast, while the offline store is a data warehouse that stores
all the features that you've computedâ€”enabling monitoring and dataset generation for training.

## Storage

Your online environment stores data that you want to cache
according to the cache policies you set on [your features](/docs/feature-caching) or
on [your queries](/docs/query-caching). While this is usually a small amount of data,
you want exceptionally fast reads.
This kind of access pattern aligns
with the performance characteristics of [Redis](https://redis.com) or [BigTable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable),
which Chalk uses to store your online data.

The offline environment stores far more data than the online environment.
It keeps a record of [all online runs](#online-to-offline)
and indexes all data brought in from your offline data sources.
Chalk offers a number of different data warehouse systems for our large-scale
offline storage depending on customer needs and deployment type,
including BigQuery, Snowflake, and Redshift.

In addition, offline queries write their output to a [parquet file](https://parquet.apache.org/)
in cloud storage (S3/GCS), whereas online queries write their results to database.

## Querying

Every request you make to Chalk for data is done through a query and every query
you make is either an online or an offline query.

Online queries are used to receive information about a single entity.
For example, you might be looking to compute the features of a
credit model for a single user, or decide what products to suggest
to a customer. Thus, online queries are designed to be as quick as possible -
within milliseconds. You can use our [API client](/docs/query-basics) to run
queries.

Offline queries are used to sample historical data about many entities
at specific points in time for model training or investigation.
When you execute an offline query, Chalk will kick off a job that acquires the requested data for
every primary key/timestamp combination presented. This could take a few seconds!
Since offline queries often lookup data for thousands of
rows, they are not designed to be used to make millisecond-level decisions.
See our guide on [querying training data](/docs/training-client)
for a more in-depth treatment.

## Online/Offline Interaction

### Online-to-Offline

After an online resolver runs, its values are copied into the [offline store](#storage).
When you [query the offline store](/docs/training-client),
you will receive data from both records of online runs and offline-specific resolvers.
Which data you receive depends on which data was closest to the point-in-time
that you queried.
For more information, see [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency).

### Offline-to-online

In contrast, data from the offline environment _does not_
reach the online store by default.
However, you can choose to ETL the data from an offline
resolver into the online store.
This can be helpful, for example,
when you tolerate stale data in online inference and
have a data source in the offline environment that doesn't
have a direct replacement in the online environment.
More details are provided in the section [Reverse ETL](/docs/reverse-etl).
