Chalk offers a variety of tools and strategies for testing your features, resolvers, and
queries in the process of deploying them to production. Testing through writing [unit tests](/docs/unit-tests)
and [integration tests](/docs/integration-tests) can ensure that your code is working as expected.
Chalk also offers blue-green deployments for a release strategy that can further minimize downtime
and risk when deploying changes. If your team is interested in using blue-green deployments in your
production environment, please reach out to the Chalk team.

## Blue-Green Deployments with Chalk

Chalk offers blue-green deployments as a way to minimize downtime when deploying new code by
running two deployments, one "blue" and one "green", in parallel. The blue deployment is the current
production deployment, while the green deployment is the new version of the code that is being
released. Using deployment tags, Chalk can route a specified percentage of traffic to the blue
or green deployment, allowing for a gradual rollout of the new code, as well as an easy path to
rollback if any issues arise.

### Releasing using Blue-Green Deployments

Once you have confirmed with the Chalk team that blue-green deployments are enabled in your Chalk environment,
there are a few ways that you can start to use blue-green deployments.

#### Full rollouts using Blue-Green Deployments

The simplest way to start to use blue-green deployments is to use the `--bluegreen` tag when deploying your code.
When you run a `chalk apply --bluegreen`, that will automatically tag your latest deployment with either `blue`
if the latest deployment was tagged `green`, or `green` if the latest deployment was tagged `blue`. Then, when you're
ready to migrate traffic to your new deployment, you can run `chalk traffic promote`, which will migrate traffic from
the deployment currently in use to the other tagged deployment. The following example demonstrates how to use
these blue-green deployments.

Suppose you have made changes that you now want to release. You can then run

```bash
$ chalk apply --bluegreen
```

Based on whether the current deployment handling traffic is tagged `blue` or `green`, the latest deployment
will be tagged with the other tag. Then, you can run the following to migrate traffic.

```bash
$ chalk traffic promote
```

Say your previous deployment was tagged `blue` and the latest deployment was tagged `green`. Then this migrates 100%
of the traffic from the `blue` deployment to the `green` deployment. You can then monitor the `green` deployment
traffic. If you encounter any errors with your new deployment, then you can once again run `chalk traffic promote` and
it will migrate traffic from the `green` deployment back to the `blue` deployment. This allows you to easily rollback
during releases.

#### Gradual rollouts using Blue-Green Deployments

If you would like to gradually roll out your new deployment with staged increments of traffic, you can
use the `--deployment-tag` flag to specify a new deployment towards which to direct traffic.
To get started with blue-green deployments, you can tag the current deployment with `blue`. To do so you can
run the following Chalk CLI commands:

```bash
$ chalk apply --deployment-tag blue
$ chalk traffic set --tags blue=100
```

This will tag the current deployment with `blue` and direct 100% of traffic to the `blue` deployment. Then, when you
are ready to begin rolling out the next deployment, you can deploy the new version of code with the tag `green`.

```bash
$ chalk apply --deployment-tag green
$ chalk traffic set --tags blue=90,green=10
```

This will direct 90% of traffic to the `blue` deployment and 10% of traffic to the `green` deployment. You can
verify the traffic distribution by running `chalk traffic get`.

```bash
$ chalk traffic get

tags:
     - deployment_id: cm9n46thy000bwe6y784y4j0l
       tag: blue
       weight: 90
     - deployment_id: cm9n3vx7c0004we6yefnsw8kg
       tag: green
       weight: 10
```

Then, you can gradually increase traffic to the `green` deployment until it is at 100%, and for the next time
you release, you can tag the latest deployment with `blue` and migrate traffic from the `green` deployment to the
even newer `blue` deployment. This workflow enables you to have fine-tuned control over the traffic distribution
between your deployments. Furthermore, Chalk will automatically scale down unused deployments to minimize unnecessary
resource usage. If you run the command `chalk traffic set` and do not specify some amount of traffic for a
tagged deployment, then Chalk will recognize that the deployment is no longer in use and will scale it down.

## Should I use Blue-Green Deployments?

Blue-green deployments are a powerful tool for minimizing downtime through a gradual rollout deployment. However,
running two deployments in parallel also has resource implications and may not be necessary for all teams. We
would recommend blue-green deployments for teams that have a high volume of traffic in their production environments
where the benefit of minimizing downtime risk is worth the cost of additional resources required.

If you are interested in using blue-green deployments, please reach out to the Chalk team and we can help you
determine what configurations are best suited for your release strategy. 


## Mirror Traffic

Chalk also offers a mirror traffic feature that allows you to mirror traffic from your production deployment to a
new deployment. This is useful for testing new features in a production-like environment without affecting the
production traffic. To use mirror traffic, you can run the following command:

```bash
# Mirror 5% of traffic to the green deployment
$ chalk traffic mirror --deployment-tag green --weight 5
```

Note: mirror traffic does not block responses for existing production traffic. It simply mirrors the traffic to the
new deployment without waiting to receive a response from the new deployment.

Metrics, logs, and traces from the mirrored traffic will be available in the new deployment. Queries will not
impact the online store, but will impact the offline store if the new deployment is configured to write to
the offline store. This permits statistical analysis of the new deployment using tooling like the query log
or the offline store.


### Light-weight Cookbook

You can make use of only mirroring with minimal reference to blue-green by:

1. Deploying your new code with the `--deployment-tag` flag to tag the deployment.
2. Mirroring traffic to the new deployment using the `--weight` flag to specify the percentage of traffic to mirror.
3. Monitoring the new deployment for any issues.

Example commands:

```bash
# Make the new deployment -- it won't receive any traffic yet
$ chalk apply --deployment-tag green

# Mirror 5% of traffic to the green deployment
$ chalk traffic mirror --deployment-tag green --weight 5

# Monitor the new deployment for any issues. Once you're satisfied, you can promote it to production with:
$ chalk traffic promote
```
