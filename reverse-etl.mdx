title: Reverse ETL
description: Move data from offline to online.

Reverse ETL is the process of moving data from a data warehouse into
operational systems. In the context of
[Chalk's architecture](/docs/architecture),
our data warehouse is the offline data store
([Timescale](https://timescale.com) or [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/))
and our operational system is the online data store
([Redis](https://redis.com), [Cloud Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), or
[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)). The online data store is queried by one of our [API
clients](/docs/query-basics), while the offline data store queried by our [bulk
API](/docs/training-client).

Data from online resolvers is always loaded into the offline store
and made available for training.
In contrast,
data from offline resolvers is _not_ loaded into online stores by default.
To enable offline data to reach the online environment,
use the keyword argument `etl_offline_to_online` on the feature you wish to ETL.

```py
@features
class User:
    ...
    favorite_color: str = feature(etl_offline_to_online=True)

@offline
def fn(...) -> DataFrame[User.favorite_color, ...]:
    ...
```

When this argument is present in the feature declaration,
Chalk copies this feature into the online environment.

Reverse ETL can also be assigned to all features in a namespace:

```py
@features(etl_offline_to_online=True)
class User:
    fraud_score: float
    full_name: str
    email: str = feature(etl_offline_to_online=False)
    ...
```

Here, `User.fraud_score` and `User.full_name`
will be reverse ETL'd into the online environment.
However, `User.email`, which specifies the ETL parameter at the feature level,
will not be reverse ETL'd.

[//]: # 'copying the data into the online environment'
[//]: # 'that can be overridden with a fixed schedule'
[//]: # 'by supplying a [duration](/docs/duration) instead'
[//]: # 'of `True` for the `etl_offline_to_online` parameter.'

## Interplay with max staleness

When data from an offline store reaches an online store,
it is necessarily somewhat stale.
The data may have come from an events table,
where it could be arbitrarily old,
or it could be a snapshot that was live when the
snapshot was taken, but takes non-zero time to
migrate online.
Therefore, you will only receive offline data
from queries in the online environment when you
your queries tolerate
[maximum staleness via features](/docs/feature-caching)
or [maximum staleness via queries](/docs/query-caching).
