Resolvers can raise errors in the course of executing,
and handle errors in resolving other feature values.

## Raising errors

If your resolver fails by raising an exception,
the error will be surfaced as a
[ChalkError](/docs/query-errors#chalkerror)
in query responses.
Clients will receive a `null` value for the feature,
and by default,
downstream resolvers won't run.

## Handling errors

By default, if there was an error in computing one of the inputs
to a resolver, that resolver will also fail with the error code
[UPSTREAM_FAILED](/docs/query-errors#error-code).
To handle failures in the input features, take as input the feature
value, but wrapped in [typing.Optional](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Optional/):

```py
from typing import Optional

@online
def fn(score: Optional[User.fraud_score]) -> ...:
```

The argument `score` will receive the value `None` in the case of a failure.

If you'd like to provide a default value to use in the case of a failure, you can use Python's syntax for assigning
a default value to an argument:

```py
@online
def fn(score: Optional[User.fraud_score] = -1) -> ...:
```
