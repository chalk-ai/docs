title: Online and Offline Stores
description: Selecting an online and offline store for your environment
---

When setting up a new environment, Chalk provides several options for choosing a storage provider
for your online and offline store. The DBMS (Database Management System) that you choose will depend on your
specific requirements, as well as your cloud deployment provider.

## Online Store Options

The Chalk online store is used for low-latency serving of real-time feature values. Although Chalk's query engine
is optimized for efficient computation of feature values by compiling Python and SQL resolvers into Rust and C++,
caching computed values in the online store can further improve performance.

### GCP Online Store Options

| Store       | Description                              | Performance | Scalability | Cost |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Cloud SQL   | Postgres (relational database)           | milliseconds, disk IO bottlenecks possible
| Memorystore | Redis (in-memory key-value NoSQL store)  | microseconds, in-memory
| Big Table   | Distributed wide-column NoSQL database   |


### AWS

Postgres (Amazon RDS)
Redis (Amazon Elasticache)
DynamoDB

### Azure

Postgres (Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
Redis (Azure Cache for Redis)


## Offline Store Options

### GCP

Big Query

### AWS

Amazon Redshift

### Azure


Chalk uses several storage technologies

we offer four types of online stores:
postgres ( amazon rds, google cloudsql)
redis (elasticache, google memorystore, amazon elasticache)
dynamodb
big table
we offer four types of offline stores?
Google Big Query
Amazon Redshift
Snowflake
Dbricks Delta Lake

Online Store Options
1. Redis or DynamoDB
- Tradeoffs:
- Performance: High throughput and low latency are achieved with Redis, making it suitable for key-value access patterns.
- Scalability: DynamoDB is highly scalable but may introduce some latency due to its distributed nature.
- Cost: Redis can be more cost-effective for smaller datasets, while DynamoDBâ€™s pricing can grow with large-scale data usage.
2. BigTable (if considering horizontal scalability)
- Tradeoffs:
- Scalability: Excellent for massive datasets and high-throughput applications.
- Cost: May be more expensive than traditional key-value stores depending on the usage pattern and data size.
Offline Store Options
1. Snowflake, BigQuery, or Delta Lake
- Tradeoffs:
- Storage & Computation: Optimized for storing historical feature values and performing batch queries. They are excellent for analytics and larger datasets.
- Cost & Complexity: Snowflake and BigQuery can incur costs based on usage, and managing large datasets may require more complex query optimizations compared to simpler storage solutions.
2. TimescaleDB (if considering time-series data)
- Tradeoffs:
- Time-Series Capabilities: Great for time-series data with robust querying capabilities.
- Cost: Can offer savings for specific data access patterns compared to more general-purpose data warehouses.
General Considerations
- Feature Caching: Using an online store allows for the usage of max_staleness, enabling faster response times and cache hits.
- Data Latency & Freshness: The choice of the online store impacts how fresh data is served. For real-time applications, using a fast online store with caching features is vital.
- Integration Complexity: Some options may require additional setup or configuration, depending on the selected technology stack and your environment's architecture.
