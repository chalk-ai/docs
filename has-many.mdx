Has-many relationships link a feature to many instances of another feature.

## Recommended Implementation

The recommended way to specify a join for a has-many relationship is implicitly. In the
example below, a `User` is linked to potentially multiple `Transfer`s.

```py
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame, ...

@features
class Transfer:
    id: str
    # note, the annotation must be a string reference because User is
    # defined after Transfer.
    user_id: "User.id"
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer]
```

## Explicit Join

The following example, which explicitly sets the join, is equivalent to the above:

```py
from chalk.features import has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Transfer:
    id: str
    user_id: str
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer] = has_many(lambda: Transfer.user_id == User.id)
```

## Aggregations on References

Having established a has-many relationship, you can now reference the transfers for
a user through the user namespace. The `has_many` feature returns a [chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe),
which supports many helpful aggregation operations:

```py
# Number of transfers made by a user
User.transfers.count()

# Total amount of transfers made by the user
User.transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()

# Total amount of the transfers made by the user that were returned
User.transfers[
    Transfer.status == "returned",
    Transfer.amount
].sum()
```

## Back-references

### One-to-many

In the reverse direction, a one-to-many relation is defined by a [has_one](/docs/has-one)
relation (following the above example, a user has many transfers but a transfer has a
single user). However, you don't have to explicitly set the join a second time. Instead,
the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over. To complete the one-to-many
relationship from our example, add a `User` to the `Transfer` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={manyToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here, you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

[//]: # (Alternatively, you could define the join condition on the same)

[//]: # (side, and add the [DataFrame]&#40;/docs/dataframe&#41; to the `User` class:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (<PyDiffEditor html={oneToManyDiff} />)

[//]: # (<TipInfo>Again, you need to use quotes around `User` deal with forward references.</TipInfo>)

### Many-to-many

Many-to-many relations are defined by has-many relationship on both sides of the relation.
As before, you don't need to specify the join condition a second time if the join
condition is symmetric.

<PyDiffEditor html={manyToManyDiff} />

<TipInfo>
  Here you need to use quotes around `DataFrame[Author]` to use a forward reference.
</TipInfo>
