Has-many relationships link a feature to many instances of another feature.

---

## Foreign Keys

The recommended way to specify a join for a has-many relationship is implicitly. In the
example below, a `User` is linked to potentially multiple `Transfer`s.

```py
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame

@features
class Transfer:
    id: str
    # note, the annotation must be a string reference because User is
    # defined after Transfer.
    user_id: "User.id"
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer]
```

---

## Explicit Join

The following example, which explicitly sets the join, is equivalent to the above:

```py
from chalk.features import has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Transfer:
    id: str
    user_id: str
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer] = has_many(lambda: Transfer.user_id == User.id)

```

### Composite Join Keys

You can also specify multiple join keys for a has-many relationship. For example, say hospitals wants to
compute aggregations over visit to each of their departments. We could write the following feature classes.

```python
from chalk import _
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame, has_many
import chalk.functions as F
from datetime import datetime


@features
class HospitalVisit:
    id: str = _.user_id + _.hospital + _.department + F.cast(_.date, str)
    composite_key: str = _.hospital + "-" + _.department
    department: str
    hospital: str
    user_id: str
    date: datetime

@features
class HospitalDepartment:
    id: int
    name: str
    hospital_name: str
    composite_key_match: str = _.hospital_name + "-" + _.name
    # multi-feature join
    visits: DataFrame[HospitalVisit] = has_many(
      lambda:
       (HospitalDepartment.hospital_name == HospitalVisit.hospital) &
       (HospitalDepartment.name == HospitalVisit.department)
    )
    # composite key join
    visits_with_composite_key: DataFrame[HospitalVisit] = has_many(
      lambda: HospitalDepartment.composite_key_match == HospitalVisit.composite_key
    )
```

You can also join in Has-Many relationships for features that have primary composite keys.

```py
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame, has_many

@features
class SoftwareEngineer:
    id: int = _.first_name + " " + _.last_name
    first_name: str
    last_name: str

    manager_id: str

@features
class Manager:
    id: int
    direct_reports: DataFrame[SoftwareEngineer] = has_many(
      lambda: Manager.id == SoftwareEngineer.manager_id
    )
```

---

## Aggregations on References

Having established a has-many relationship, you can now reference the transfers for
a user through the user namespace. The `has_many` feature returns a [chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe),
which supports many helpful aggregation operations:

```python
# Number of transfers made by a user
User.transfers.count()

# Total amount of transfers made by the user
User.transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()

# Total amount of the transfers made by the user that were returned
User.transfers[
    Transfer.status == "returned",
    Transfer.amount
].sum()
```

To compute an aggregation over one or more time windows, see our docs on [windowed aggregations](/docs/aggregations).

## Back-references

### One-to-many

In the reverse direction, a one-to-many relation is defined by a [has_one](/docs/has-one)
relation (following the above example, a user has many transfers but a transfer has a
single user). However, you don't have to explicitly set the join a second time. Instead,
the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over. To complete the one-to-many
relationship from our example, add a `User` to the `Transfer` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={manyToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here, you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

[//]: # (Alternatively, you could define the join condition on the same)

[//]: # (side, and add the [DataFrame]&#40;/docs/dataframe&#41; to the `User` class:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (<PyDiffEditor html={oneToManyDiff} />)

[//]: # (<TipInfo>Again, you need to use quotes around `User` deal with forward references.</TipInfo>)

### Many-to-many

The recommended way to define a many-to-many relationship is through a joining feature class.
For instance, to define a many-many relationship between `Actors` and `Movies`, you
could write the following feature classes:

```python
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame

@features
class Actor:
    id: int
    appearances: "DataFrame[MovieRole]"
    full_name: str

    # this will be used to demonstrate one of the
    # ways the joining feature can be populated
    movie_ids: list[int]

@features
class Movie:
    id: int
    title: str

@features
class MovieRole:
    id: str
    actor_id: Actor.id
    movie_id: Movie.id
    movie: Movie
```

<TipInfo>
  Here you need to use quotes around `DataFrame[MovieRole]` to use a forward reference.
</TipInfo>

This joining feature class can be populated by a SQL file resolver:
```sql
-- resolves: MovieRole
-- source: PG
SELECT id, actor_id, movie_id FROM movie_roles;
```

Alternatively, by a `DataFrame`-returning Python resolver (namespaced to one of the joined feature sets):

```python
@online
def get_actor_in_movie(
  a_id: Actor.id,
  movie_ids: Actor.movie_ids,
) -> Actor.appearances:
  return DataFrame([
    MovieRole(
      id=f"{a_id}_{m_id}",
      actor_id=a_id,
      movie_id=m_id
    )
    for m_id in movie_ids
  ])
```

The joining feature class lets you:
- query for movie features from the `Actor` namespace, and
- use movie features in downstream `Actor` resolvers.

For example, to get the titles for all the movies that an actor has appeared in, you can run the following query:

```bash
$ chalk query --in actor.id=1 --out actor.appearances.movie.title
Results

 Name                           Hit?  Value
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 actor.appearances.movie.title        ["The Bad Sleep Well","High and Low",...]
```
