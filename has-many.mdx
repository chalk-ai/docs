A feature set can be linked to many examples of a different feature set
via the function `has_many`, where the first argument specifies a
function returning how to join the tables.

##Recommended Implementation

Specified below is the simplest way to demonstrate a has-many relationship and its join.

```py
from chalk.features import DataFrame, ...

@features
class Transfer:
    ...
    user_id: str
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    ...
    uid: Transfer.user_id
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer]
```

This denotes that a user has many transactions, and that `User.uid` is of type `str` and equals `Transfer.user_id`.
The following example, which explicitly sets the join, is equivalent.

```py
from chalk.features import has_many, DataFrame, ...

@features
class Transfer:
    ...
    user_id: str
    amount: float

@features
class User:
    ...
    uid: str
    transfers: DataFrame[Transfer] = has_many(lambda: Transfer.user_id == User.uid)
```

Now, you can reference the transfers for a user through the user.
The `has_many` function returns a [chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe),
which supports many helpful aggregate operations:

```py
# Number of transfers made by a user
User.transfers.count()

# Total amount of transfers made by the user
User.transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()

# Total amount of the transfers made by the user that were returned
User.transfers[
    Transfer.status = "returned",
    Transfer.amount
].sum()
```

## Back-references

### One-to-many

One-to-many is defined by a [has_one](/docs/has-one) relationship
on the other side of the relation.
However, you don't have to explicitly use [has_one](/docs/has-one).
Instead, the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over.
Building on the above example, all you need to do
to complete the one-to-many relationship is to add a `User` to
the `Transfer` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={manyToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

Alternatively, you could define the join condition on the [has_one](/docs/has-one)
side, and add the [DataFrame](/docs/dataframe) to the `User` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={oneToManyDiff} />
<TipInfo>Again, you need to use quotes around `User` deal with forward references.</TipInfo>

### Many-to-many

Many-to-many is defined by a `has_many` relationship
on the both sides of the relation.
As before, you don't need to specify the join condition a second time
so long as the join condition is symmetric.

<PyDiffEditor html={manyToManyDiff} />

<TipInfo>
  Here you need to use quotes around `DataFrame[Author]` to use a forward reference.
</TipInfo>
