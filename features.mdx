Chalk lets you spell out your features directly in Python.
Features are namespaced to a `FeatureSet`.
To create a new `FeatureSet`, apply the `@features`
decorator to a Python class with typed attributes.
A `FeatureSet` is constructed and functions much like
Python's own
[dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html).

## Example

```py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    full_name: str
    nickname: Optional[str]
    email: Optional[str]
    birthday: datetime
    fraud_score: float
```

## Namespacing

Features are namespaced by their containing `FeatureSet`,
and then by the name of the variable.

In the above example, our features, when rendered as strings, are:

| Feature Name     | Type                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user.id          | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Integer </code>        |
| user.full_name   | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String </code>         |
| user.nickname    | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String \| None </code> |
| user.email       | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String \| None </code> |
| user.birthday    | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Datetime </code>       |
| user.fraud_score | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Decimal </code>        |

(`FeatureSet` names are stripped of the suffix "Features",
if it exists).

### Overrides

Feature names and feature classes can be overridden by supplying
the `name` keyword argument to the `feature` function or the `@features` decorator.
This practice allows us to evolve our variable names without
losing the past history of this feature.

## Primary keys

Feature sets must all have a primary key.
This primary key is used to index storage for features you later resolve
in this feature class. Your primary key can have type `int` or `str`,
given by the type annotation on the field.

By default, if you have a feature with the name `id`,
that feature will be the primary key.
However, you can override this behavior:

```py
from chalk.features import features, Primary

@features
class User:
    user_id: Primary[str]
    ...
```

If you mark an explicit primary key, it will override the default behavior:

```py
@features
class User:
    user_id: Primary[str]
    # Not really the primary key!
    id: str
```

Alternatively, you can use the [`feature`](/api-docs#feature) function
to set a feature to primary:

```py
from chalk.features import features, feature

@features
class User:
    user_id: str = feature(primary=True)
```

## Versions

Chalk versions all of your features with every deployment.
However, you can also choose explicit versions for your
features.

```py
@features
class User:
    ...
    email_domain: str = feature(version=2)
```

## Feature time

By default, Chalk marks the time a feature was created as the time that
its resolver was run.
However, you may want to provide a custom value for this time
for data sources like events tables.

You can inspect the time a feature was created and set the time
for when a feature was created by creating a feature assigned to the
`feature_time()` function.

<PyDiffEditor html={featureTimeCode} />

To set the time a feature was created, assign the feature
when you resolve it:

```py
@offline
def fn(uid: User.uuid) -> Features[User.name, User.ts]:
    return User(
        name="Anousheh Ansari",
        ts=datetime(month=9, day=12, year=1966)
    )
```

Then, when you [sample offline data](/docs/temporal-consistency),
the name feature will be treated as having been created at
the provided date.

## Constructing feature classes

To construct a `User` instance, supply the feature values
to the `__init__()` method

```py
User(full_name="Grace Hopper", nickname="Amazing Grace")
User(email="grace.hopper@yale.edu")
```

The `@features` decorator adds a custom `__init__()`:

```py
def __init__(
    self,
    uid: int | MISSING = MISSING,
    full_name: str | MISSING = MISSING,
    email: Optional[str] | MISSING = MISSING,
    ...
):
    self.uid = uid
    self.full_name = full_name
    self.email = email
    ...
```

Note that all fields have a default `MISSING` value.
Therefore, you can construct feature classes with any subset
of the fields you would like to use.

## Refactoring

After going to production, you may find that you want to change
the name of a property on the feature class.
You can change the name of a feature property without changing
the underlying data using the [name override](/docs/features#overrides).
From the example in the [namespacing section](/docs/features#overrides),
if you initially called a feature `birthday`,
and decided to rename it `date_of_birth`,
you can keep the underlying data the same and rename the property
on the class as follows:

<PyDiffEditor html={highlightedCode} />

Here, we also rename the feature class originally named `Prince`
to `TheArtistFormerlyKnownAsPrince`.

### Interplay with auto-id

Where the name of the Python property
and the name provided to `feature(name=...)` differ,
IDs are [auto-assigned](/docs/features#primary-keys) based
on the name provided to `feature(name=...)`.

## Default feature values

For features that can't always be computed, you can pass `default` to
[`feature`](/api-docs#feature.default), or assign a default directly:

```python
from chalk.features import features
@features
class User:
    num_purchases: int = 0
```
