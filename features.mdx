Chalk lets you spell out your features directly in Python.
Features are namespaced to a `FeatureSet`.
To create a new `FeatureSet`, apply the `@features`
decorator to a Python class with typed attributes.
A `FeatureSet` is constructed and functions much like
Python's own
[dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html).

## Example

```py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from chalk.features import features

@features
class UserFeatures:
    id: int
    full_name: str
    nickname: Optional[str]
    email: Optional[str]
    birthday: datetime
    fraud_score: float
```

## Namespacing

Features are namespaced by their containing `FeatureSet`,
and then by the name of the variable.

In the above example, our features, when rendered as strings, are:

| Feature Name     | Type                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user.id          | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Integer </code>        |
| user.full_name   | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String </code>         |
| user.nickname    | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String \| None </code> |
| user.email       | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> String \| None </code> |
| user.birthday    | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Datetime </code>       |
| user.fraud_score | <code className="whitespace-nowrap before:content-none text-pink-400 after:content-none"> Decimal </code>        |

(`FeatureSet` names are stripped of the suffix "Features",
if it exists).

### Overrides

Feature names and feature classes can be overridden by supplying
the `name` keyword argument to the `feature` function or the `@features` decorator.
This practice allows us to evolve our variable names without
losing the past history of this feature.

## Primary keys

Feature sets must all have a primary key.
This primary key is used to associate features you later resolve
with this namespace. Your primary key can have any type,
given by the type annotation on the field.

By default, if you have a feature with the name `id`,
that feature will be the primary key.
However, you can override this behavior:

```py
from chalk.features import features, Primary

@features
class User:
    user_id: Primary[str]
    ...
```

If you mark an explicit primary key, it will override the default behavior:

```py
@features
class User:
    user_id: Primary[str]
    # Not really the primary key!
    id: str
```

Alternatively, you can use the `feature(...)` function
to set a feature to primary:

```py
from chalk.features import features, feature

@features
class User:
    user_id: str = feature(primary=True)
```

## Versions

Chalk versions all of your features with every deployment.
However, you can also choose explicit versions for your
features.

```py
@features
class User:
    ...
    email_domain: str = feature(version=2)
```

## Feature time

By default, Chalk marks the time a feature was created as the time that
its resolver was run.
However, you may want to provide a custom value for this time
for data sources like events tables.

You can inspect the time a feature was created and set the time
for when a feature was created by creating a feature assigned to the
`feature_time()` function.

<PyDiffEditor html={featureTimeCode} />

To set the time a feature was created, assign the feature
when you resolve it:

```py
@offline
def fn(uid: User.uuid) -> Features[User.name, User.ts]:
    return User(
        name="Anousheh Ansari",
        ts=datetime(month=9, day=12, year=1966)
    )
```

Then, when you [sample offline data](/docs/temporal-consistency),
the name feature will be treated as having been created at
the provided date.

## Constructing feature classes

To construct a `UserFeatures` instance, supply the feature values
to the `__init__()` method

```py
UserFeatures(full_name="Grace Hopper", nickname="Amazing Grace")
UserFeatures(email="grace.hopper@yale.edu")
```

The `@features` decorator adds a custom `__init__()`:

```py
def __init__(
    self,
    uid: int | MISSING = MISSING,
    full_name: str | MISSING = MISSING,
    email: Optional[str] | MISSING = MISSING,
    ...
):
    self.uid = uid
    self.full_name = full_name
    self.email = email
    ...
```

Note that all fields have a default `MISSING` value.
Therefore, you can construct feature classes with any subset
of the fields you would like to use.

Chalk ships a [Mypy Plugin](/docs/editor-setup) that helps with
many of the types in the Chalk package, including to check that
`FeatureSets` are constructed
[only with features](/docs/editor-setup#feature-value-type-checking)
available on the class.

## Refactoring

After going to production, you may find that you want to change
the name of a property on the feature class.
You can change the name of a feature property without changing
the underlying data using the [name override](/docs/features#overrides).
From the example in the [namespacing section](/docs/features#overrides),
if you initially called a feature `birthday`,
and decided to rename it `date_of_birth`,
you can keep the underlying data the same and rename the property
on the class as follows:

<PyDiffEditor html={highlightedCode} />

Here, we also rename the feature class originally named `Prince`
to `TheArtistFormerlyKnownAsPrince`.

### Interplay with auto-id

Where the name of the Python property
and the name provided to `feature(name=...)` differ,
IDs are [auto-assigned](/docs/features#primary-keys) based
on the name provided to `feature(name=...)`.
