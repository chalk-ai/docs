Features can capture metadata to inform
alerting, monitoring, and discovery.
By default, features are created as any type-annotated
variable of a class decorated with `@features`.
However, you may also assign these variables to the
result of the `chalk.features.feature(...)` function
to provide metadata.

## Description

Descriptions are parsed from the comments preceding
the feature definition. For example, you can document a
`fraud_score` feature with information about the values
as follows:

```py
@features
class User:
    # **0 to 100 score indicating an identity match.**
    # **Low scores indicate safer users**
    fraud_score: float
    ...
```

You can alternatively provide a description of a feature
directly in the code. The following example is equivalent to
explicitly providing the description as above:

```py
@features
class User:
    fraud_score: float = feature(description="""
           **0 to 100 score indicating an identity match.**
           **Low scores indicate safer users**
        """)
    ...
```

If both an explicit description and a comment are present,
the description will be set to the explicit value from
`feature(description=...)`.

You can programmatically access the description for a feature
with the `description(...)` function:

```py
from chalk.feature import description
print(description(User.fraud_score))
```

## Owner

You may also specify which person or group is responsible for an individual feature.
The owner tag will be available in Chalk's web portal.
Alerts that do not otherwise have an owner will be assigned
to the owner of the monitored feature.
Owners are parsed from the source code. For example:

```py
@features
class User:
    full_name: str
    # :owner: **katherine.johnson@nasa.gov**
    fraud_score: float
    ...
```

You may instead choose to specify an owner via a keyword argument to
`feature()`.
For example:

```py
@features
class User:
    full_name: str
    fraud_score: float = feature(owner="**katherine.johnson@nasa.gov**")
    ...
```

An owner can also be assigned to _every_ feature in a namespace via a keyword argument to `@features`:

```py
@features(owner="**katherine.johnson@nasa.gov**")
class User:
    full_name: str
    fraud_score: float
    # :owner: **annie.easley@nasa.gov**
    email: str
    ...
```

Here, `User.full_name` and `User.fraud_score`
assume the owner `katherine.johnson@nasa.gov`.
However, `User.email`, which specifies an owner at the feature level,
assumes the owner `annie.easley@nasa.gov`.

You can programmatically access the owner of a feature
with the `owner(...)` function:

```py
from chalk.feature import owner
assert owner(User.email) == "annie.easley@nasa.gov"
```

## Tags

Tags are a way of adding metadata to features for use in
filtering, aggregations, and visualizations.
For example, you can use tags to assign features to a team
and find all features for a given team.

```py
@features
class User:
    # :tags: **team:identity**, **priority:high**
    fraud_score: float
    ...
```

Alternatively, you may specify tags via explicit construction:

```py
@features
class User:
    fraud_score: float = feature(tags=[
        "**team:identity**",
        "**priority:high**",
    ])
    ...
```

As with the owner property, tags can be assigned to all features in a namespace:

```py
@features(tags="**group:risk**")
class User:
    fraud_score: float
    # :tags: pii
    email: str
    ...
```

Here, `User.fraud_score` inherits the tag `group:risk`.
The feature `User.email` will also inherit this tag
in addition to the tag `pii`.

You can programmatically access the tags for a feature
with the `tags(...)` function:

```py
from chalk.feature import tags
assert tags(User.email) == ["pii", "group:risk"]
```
