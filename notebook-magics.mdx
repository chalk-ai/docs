Chalk provides a set of [IPython magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) to improve the experience of defining resolvers in notebooks.

## Cell Magics

### %%resolver

You can define a SQL resolver in a notebook cell using the `%%resolver` magic. The magic will parse the cell contents
and upload your resolver to your current working branch.

`%%resolver` needs to be followed by a resolver name, e.g. `root_authorization_resolver` as shown below.

Refer to the section on [SQL Resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers) to learn more about how to define resolvers.

```sql notebook.ipynb
%%resolver root_authorization_resolver
-- resolves: Authorization
-- source: snowflake
SELECT
    id,
    amount_in_cents,
    card_id,
    merchant_id,
    created_at as authorized_at
FROM authorizations
```

Chalk lines up the names of your target SQL columns with the names of your features.
In this case, we have an `Authorization` feature class that contains a features called `authorized_at`.
However, our Snowflake table has a column called `created_at` that we want to use to populate the `authorized_at` feature.
So, we use the `as` keyword to rename the column in our resolver.
