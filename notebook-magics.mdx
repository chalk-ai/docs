Chalk provides a set of [IPython magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) to improve the experience of defining resolvers in notebooks.

## Cell Magics

### %%resolver

You can define a SQL resolver in a notebook cell using the `%%resolver` magic. The magic will parse the cell contents
and upload your resolver to your current working branch.

`%%resolver` needs to be followed by a resolver name, e.g. `root_authorization_resolver` as shown below.

Refer to the section on [SQL Resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers) to learn more about how to define resolvers.

```sql
%%resolver root_authorization_resolver
-- type: offline
-- resolves: Authorization
-- source: Snowflake
SELECT
    id
    amount_in_cents
    card_id
    merchant_id
    created_at as authorized_at
FROM authorizations;
```
