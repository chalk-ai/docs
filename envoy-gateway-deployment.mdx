## Introduction

Chalk uses an [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/) to route traffic to the metadata and data planes
when in a self-hosted model. Depending on how environments are set up and if they are in the same cluster,
the same gateway can be used across multiple environments.

## Prerequisites

This guide is for users who are self-hosting the Chalk Cloud. Make sure you have set up Chalk either through the
[self-guided helm installation](https://docs.chalk.ai/docs/helm-installation) or with guided support with the
Chalk Team.

Setting up and deploying an Envoy Gateway changes the way that traffic gets routed to the Chalk servers and engines
living in the Metadata and Data Planes - this is a sensitive operation and requires Admin-level access or higher.

Finally, this guide requires going through the [Envoy Quickstart](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/tasks/quickstart/)
to get Envoy installed to your cloud instance.


## Configuring an Envoy Gateway in Chalk

Navigate to the `Settings/Team/Shared Resources/Envoy Gateway` page in the Chalk UI
to view the current gateway configuration. If no gateway is configured,
you will see a message indicating that no gateway is currently present, and the
first save and apply will create a new gateway.


## Configuration Options

<AttributeTable>

  <Attribute field={"namespace"} kind={"string"}>
    The kubernetes namespace this gateway should be deployed in.
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"gateway_name"} kind={"string"}>
    A name to attach to this gateway.
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"gateway_class_name"} kind={"string"}>
    The name of the  [gateway class resource](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gatewayclass/) to use,
    for example `chalk-gateway-class`. This should be set up during Envoy quickstart.
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"listeners"} kind={"Listener[]"}>
    A list of listeners that configure which routes the proxy should use. See below section for more info on configuration
  </Attribute>
</AttributeTable>

### Listener

This is the scheme for individual listener objects:

<AttributeTable>
  <Attribute field={"name"} kind={"string"}>
    A name used to reference this listener.
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"port"} kind={"int"}>
    The port to listen to.
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"protocol"} kind={"string"}>
    The protocol to use (ex. `HTTP` or `HTTPS`)
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute field={"allowed_routes"} kind={"Listener[]"}>
    This configures the list of routes this listener is attached to, and which namespaces they can come from.
    See [the kubernetes documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/metio/k8s/latest/docs/data-sources/gateway_networking_k8s_io_gateway_v1beta1_manifest#allowed_routes)
    for more detailed information about this field.
  </Attribute>
</AttributeTable>

### Example configuration:

```json
{
  "gateway_name": "chalk-gateway",
  "gateway_class_name": "chalk-gateway-class",
  "namespace": "chalk-networking",
  "listeners": [
    {
      "name": "runway",
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "HTTP",
      "allowed_routes": {
        "namespaces": {
          "from": "All"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
