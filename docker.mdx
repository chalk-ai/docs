Chalk's runs your feature pipelines on [Docker images](https://docs.docker.com).
If your code relies only on the resolvers and data definitions you
define, using Chalk's base image with no modification is a good option.
However, if you require additional dependencies, you'll need to specify
how to install and manage them.

You can specify build options on a per-environment basis,
and you can provide a default set of configuration for
environments that do not have explicit configuration values.

## Extra pip dependencies

Chalk can install extra dependencies with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
By default, Chalk looks for a file named `requirements.txt` in the base
of your project.

However, you can override this location or specify requirements
files per-environment in the `chalk.yaml` file located at the base
of your repo.

```yaml
project: my-project-id
environments:
  default:
    runtime: python311
    requirements: ./requirements.txt
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  prod:
    requirements: ./requirements-prod.txt
```

## Building your own image

You may have dependencies that cannot be expressed through `pip`.
For those dependencies, you need to customize the base image Chalk uses
to run your pipelines.
Chalk allows you to specify a custom [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
that will be used to build a base image for your deploys.

```yaml
project: my-project-id
environments:
  default:
    dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
  prod:
    dockerfile: ./DockerfileProd
```

You build any [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-based
image that you like, with a few requirements:

- `python` must be on the path
- `pip` must be on the path
- The Python version can be `python310` or `python311`
- There should be no folder or file at `/app`

Chalk is responsible for mounting your code into
the image, and for installing your requirements with pip.

## Python Version

The Python version for a Chalk project is set at the project level.
The version is set with the `chalk.yml` file in your project repo.
Chalk supports both `python310` and `python311` as values for `runtime`:

```yaml
project: my-project-id
environments:
  default:
    runtime: python311
  prod:
    runtime: python310
```
