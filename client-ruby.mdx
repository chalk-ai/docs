# Initialize the client
client = ChalkRuby::Client.new(
  client_id: 'your-client-id',
  client_secret: 'your-client-secret',
  environment_id: 'your-environment-id'
)

# Query features
result = client.query(
  inputs: {
    'user.id' => 'user123'
  },
  outputs: [
    'user.credit_score',
    'user.account_age_days'
  ]
)

puts result
```
