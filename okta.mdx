Chalk is capable of using standard SSO providers like Google and GitHub for SSO authentication. For companies that use [Okta](https://okta.com/), additional configuration is required.

---

## Supported Features

- IDP-initiated Single Sign-On (OpenID Connect), initiated via Okta
- SP-initiated Single Sign-On (OpenID Connect), initiated from Chalk

## Requirements

- Configure a custom OIDC app in Okta's dashboard
- Send configuration parameters to Chalk support

## Configuration Steps

Currently, Chalk requires a custom OIDC app integration to work with Okta for SSO.

1. Navigate to your admin dashboard (`https://<your-domain>.okta.com/admin/apps/active`)
2. Choose "Create App Integration"

5. Submit the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" to Chalk Support, along with your Okta domain (your "issuer")
