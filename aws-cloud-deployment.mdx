Chalk's feature platform with best-in-class developer experience enables
machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models
that make their business stand out. Chalk provides a feature store so that
you can deploy production machine learning pipelines for real time data
in minutes.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy their feature and data pipeline definitions
to Chalk’s platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs &
administers its platform on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed
infrastructure then executes the customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

## IAM Role Permissions

In order to manage infrastructure in your cloud account, Chalk requires certain
IAM permissions. At a high level, Chalk needs the ability
to provision the key components of your infrastructure:

- Storage resources (buckets for dataset storage and bulk insertion into offline storage)
- Networking resources (LBs, VPCs, etc.)
- IAM resources (e.g. creating service accounts for workload identity, etc.)
- Kubernetes resources (EKS)
- Online storage ([RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), or [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), or [Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/))
- Offline storage (typically Snowflake or Redshift)

## Setup Instructions

We typically recommend the following steps for enabling Chalk to manage AWS
infrastructure in your cloud account:

- Create a new account in your AWS organization.
- Create a new [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in your root AWS organization that enables Chalk's server
  to perform actions in this account. Ensure that AssumeRole is granted.
- Create an IAM policy using the JSON document below and attach this IAM policy
  to the created role.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "*",
            "Action": [

## Ongoing permissions

Chalk's support team will work with you to scope permissions down to what are needed for ongoing maintenance.
The precise details depend on the level of ongoing support that your team needs and your compliance requirements.
In principle, Chalk does not require ongoing access to data, or to the ability to edit IAM permissions,
but Chalk requires ongoing access to update the software deployed in your environment.


### Kubernetes

Chalk requires the following Kubernetes roles to manage the resources in your cluster:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: chalk-cluster-management-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - nodes # required to track usage
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch

      - update
      - patch
      - create
      - delete
  - apiGroups:
      - "batch"
    resources:

  # For managing Jobs

      - list
  # For durable storage management.
  - apiGroups:

      - list

  # OPTIONAL: For showing thread dumps & profiling for batch backfills + some support use-cases.
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - pods/exec
    verbs:
      - create
      - get

  # OPTIONAL: For support with debugging k8s rbac, grant read-only access to this namespaces' rbac configuration.
  - apiGroups: ["", "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["roles", "serviceaccounts", "rolebindings"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Additionally, Chalk workload service accounts require the following role to be able to manage batch workloads:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: chalk-job-reader
  namespace: <namespace>  # replace <namespace> with your actual namespace
rules:
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["jobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

If you use in-cluster docker image building powered by koniko and Argo, Chalk requires this role on the namespace
where the docker image building is happening:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-role
  namespace: <namespace>  # replace <namespace> with your actual namespace
rules:
- apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
  resources: ["workflows"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

This role must be granted to the management service account that Chalk uses to manage the cluster, and to the workload
service account that runs the docker image building.
