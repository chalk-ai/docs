Chalk's feature platform with best-in-class developer experience enables
machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models
that make their business stand out. Chalk provides a feature store so that
you can deploy production machine learning pipelines for real time data
in minutes.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy their feature and data pipeline definitions
to Chalk’s platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs &
administers its platform on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed
infrastructure then executes the customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

## IAM Role Permissions

In order to manage infrastructure in your cloud account, Chalk requires certain
IAM permissions. At a high level, Chalk needs the ability
to provision the key components of your infrastructure:

- Storage resources (buckets for [Dataset](/docs/datasets) storage and bulk insertion into offline
storage)
- Networking resources (LBs, VPCs, etc.)
- IAM resources (e.g. creating service accounts for workload identity, etc.)
- Kubernetes resources (EKS)
- Online storage ([RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), or [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), or [Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/))
- Offline storage (typically Snowflake or Redshift)

## Setup Instructions

We typically recommend the following steps for enabling Chalk to manage AWS
infrastructure in your cloud account:

- Create a new account in your AWS organization.
- Create a new [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the new account that enables Chalk's server
  to perform actions in this account. Ensure that AssumeRole is granted.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::754784422779:role/chalk-api-server"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition":
{
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "<your-chalk-external-id>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

- Create an IAM policy using the JSON document below and attach this IAM policy
  to the created role.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "*",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:*",

## Ongoing permissions

Chalk's support team will work with you to scope permissions down to what are needed for ongoing maintenance.
The precise details depend on the level of ongoing support that your team needs and your compliance requirements.
In principle, Chalk does not require ongoing access to data, or to the ability to edit IAM permissions,
but Chalk requires ongoing access to update the software deployed in your environment. For managing resource
configurations such as autoscaling, the Chalk team can use an execution role that is scoped to the specific
resources that Chalk manages. It is also possible to restrict the management policy described above using
[IAM conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html).
However, in order for the Chalk team to provide the best possible support, we recommend collaborating to
scope the permissions appropriately. 


### Kubernetes

Chalk requires the following Kubernetes roles to manage the resources in your cluster:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: chalk-cluster-management-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:

      - patch
      - watch

  # OPTIONAL: For showing thread dumps & profiling for batch backfills + some support use-cases.
  - apiGroups:

    resources:
      - pods/exec
    verbs:
      - create
      - get

  # OPTIONAL: For support with debugging k8s rbac, grant read-only access to this namespaces' rbac configuration.
  - apiGroups: ["", "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["roles", "serviceaccounts", "rolebindings"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Additionally, Chalk workload service accounts require the following role to be able to manage batch workloads:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: chalk-job-reader
  namespace: <namespace>  # replace <namespace> with your actual namespace
rules:
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["jobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

If you use in-cluster docker image building powered by kaniko and Argo, Chalk requires this role on
the namespace where the docker image building is happening:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-role
  namespace: <namespace>  # replace <namespace> with your actual namespace
rules:
- apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
  resources: ["workflows"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

This role must be granted to the management service account that Chalk uses to manage the cluster, and to the workload
service account that runs the docker image building.

### Logging

In order to display logs in the Chalk web UI, Chalk requires permissions to be able to read Cloudwatch logs.
If you use a separate logging service, you can [set up Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet to send logs to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html).
Then, to view these logs we need the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:TestMetricFilter",
                "logs:StartQuery",
                "logs:StartLiveTail",
                "logs:List*",
                "logs:Get*",
                "logs:FilterLogEvents",
                "logs:Describe*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:<your account id>:log-group:<the log group path>:*",
            "Sid": "readlogs"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:StopQuery",
                "logs:StopLiveTail"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "stopActions"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

### VPC CIDR Blocks

Chalk will create the underlying [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.html) and
subnets for the EKS cluster(s) for your Chalk deployment. Typically, Chalk will request a /16 address block and
work within it. However, the number of addresses will depend on the size of your implementation. The Chalk team will
work with you to determine the appropriate CIDR sections to use.

Our default configuration is:

```yaml
vpc_cidr_block = "10.130.0.0/16"
  vpc_subnets = [
    {
      name              = "primary"
      cidr_block        = "10.130.0.0/20"
      az                = "a"
      public_cidr_block = "10.130.16.0/20"
    },
    {
      name              = "secondary"
      cidr_block        = "10.130.32.0/20"
      az                = "b"
      public_cidr_block = "10.130.48.0/20"
    },
    {
      name              = "tertiary"
      cidr_block        = "10.130.64.0/20"
      az                = "c"
      public_cidr_block = "10.130.80.0/20"
    }
  ]
```
