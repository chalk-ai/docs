Chalk enables innovative machine learning teams to focus on building
the unique products and models that make their business stand
out. Behind the scenes Chalk seamlessly handles data infrastructure
with a best-in-class developer experience.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy that code to Chalk’s
platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs & administers its platform
on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed infrastructure then executes-customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

## IAM Requirements

Chalk requires certain IAM permissions to manage infrastructure in your cloud account.
Typically, Chalk recommends:

- creating a new account in your AWS organization
- creating a new role in your root AWS organization with the permissions in this document
- granting Chalk's management role AssumeRole on the role you created

---

## Setup permissions

Chalk recommends creating a custom [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
in your organization with the following permissions granted.
At a high level, Chalk needs the ability to provision the key components of your infrastructure:

- Storage resources (buckets for dataset storage and bulk insertion into offline storage)
- Networking resources (LBs, VPCs, etc.)
- IAM resources (e.g. creating service accounts for workload identity, etc.)
- Kubernetes resources (EKS)
- Online storage ([RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), or [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), or [Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/))
- Offline storage (typically Snowflake or Redshift)

The following IAM policy is sufficient for Chalk to provision a deployment:

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "*",
            "Action": [

## Ongoing permissions

Chalk's support team will work with you to scope permissions down to what are needed for ongoing maintenance.
The precise details depend on the level of ongoing support that your team needs and your compliance requirements.
In principle, Chalk does not require ongoing access to data, or to the ability to edit IAM permissions,
but Chalk requires ongoing access to update the software deployed in your environment.


### Kubernetes Permissions

Chalk requires the following Kubernetes permissions to manage the resources in your cluster:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: chalk-cluster-management-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - nodes # required to track usage
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
