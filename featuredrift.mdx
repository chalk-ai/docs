Chalk provides a simple way to monitor feature drift by running
the [Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) for
features values over a given time period.

## Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test

The [K-S test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) is a statistical test that can be used to determine if two samples
are drawn from the same distribution. Chalk runs the test on
samples from the online store and data from a given dataset to determine if the
feature values are drawn from the same distribution.


## Charts and Alerts

To setup a chart and alert for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, start by creating a
[named dataset](/docs/datasets) for the features you want to monitor.

Then under **Settings > Global Charts**, create a new chart and click on **Add Formula**, choosing **KS TEST** as the function.
Next select the dataset you created and the feature you want to monitor.

The y-axis of the chart displays the difference between the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic and the critical value at
significance level 0.05. When the value is greater than 0, the feature values are considered to be drawn from different
distributions.

To create an Alert, click on **Add Alert Trigger** and configure the alert to trigger when the KS Test value is greater than 0.
