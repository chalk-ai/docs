Chalk resolvers are callable and [unit-testable](/docs/unit-tests) Python functions.
However, you may want to test the interactions between Chalk
resolvers with an integration test.

With branch deploys, you can deploy and test your changes before
shipping your code to production.

---

## Branch deployments

Chalk allows you to create an unlimited number of branch deployments.
Branch deployments run all of your resolvers in the same way
that they run in production. However, branch deployments don't impact
the [offline store](/docs/training-client).

### Creating a branch deployment

You can create a branch deployment in the same
way that you create a full deployment by passing
the flag [`--branch <branch_name>`](/cli/apply).

```bash
# --branch creates a branch deployment
> chalk apply --force --await --branch <branch_name>
```

The [`--await`](/cli/apply#await) flag means that the deployment will
be live by the time that the command returns.

### Querying a branch deployment

You can quickly check your branch deployment using
[`chalk query --branch`](/cli/query) on the command line to
pull feature values:

```bash
# Example of making a query directly
> chalk query --branch <branch_name> \
              --in user.id=1 \
              --out user.id \
              --out user.email
```

The flag [`--branch`](/cli/query) tells this query to target the branch set during `chalk apply`.

---

## Integration test

You can also target a branch from the
[Chalk API client](/docs/query-basics).
Using this client, you can write integration tests:

<PyEditor html={integrationTest} filename={'integration_test.py'} />

---

## GitHub Action

Chalk can be easily integrated in a
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/chalk-ai/cli-action).
You will need to create a Chalk token from the settings
page of your dashboard and store the resulting client
id and secret as
[GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
