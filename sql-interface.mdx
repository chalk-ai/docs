Chalk is testing a direct SQL query interface for your feature values and
data sources in your environment. In the dashboard, under `Data Explorer`,
you can find several interfaces that you can use to query your data. The
Online Query Explorer and Offline Query Explorer enable you to execute
[online queries](/docs/query-online) and [offline queries](/docs/query-offline),
respectively, from the dashboard. In addition, you can use the SQL Query
Interface to query against previously computed feature values from your
offline store as well as data sources in your environment.

Additionally, you can use the [GRPC client's run_sql() endpoint](/api-docs#ChalkGRPCClient.run_sql).

## Query Syntax

Chalk's SQL interface uses a standard SQL dialect, and all queries are processed through a parser that expects 
familiar SQL syntax.

Currently, Chalk SQL only supports making `SELECT` queries, with the following restrictions:
- `SELECT` list:
    - Column references cannot be qualified yet. If a column in a table has a `.` delimiter, you may reference it with
      double quotes, e.g. `SELECT "column.with.dot" FROM table`.
    - A subset of Chalk's [expressions](/docs/expression) are automatically exposed as top-level functions in the SQL
      interface.
- `FROM` clause:
    - You can query tables that are exposed by the Chalk catalog. See [SQL Interface Sources](#sql-interface-sources) for more details.
    - You can also query against the following table-valued functions
        - `read_parquet(path: str)`: Reads a Parquet file from the given path and returns a table. Path must be a literal string.
        - `query_values_from_operation_ids(operation_id: str, ...)`: Returns a table consisting of the values queried in the
          given operation id(s). The operation id(s) provided must correspond to queries that have the same output schema.
- `WHERE` clause:
    - Column references cannot be qualified yet. As such, `JOIN`s are not possible yet.
    - You can use any of the supported expressions available in ChalkSQL as part of your WHERE clause.
    - A best-effort attempt of pushdown is made for the expressions used in the `WHERE` clause, but not all expressions
      are guaranteed to be pushed down to the underlying data source.
- `GROUP BY` clause:
    - At present, you may only use direct column references in the `GROUP BY` clause.
- `LIMIT` clause:
    - You may use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows returned by your query. The value must be a literal integer.
- `ORDER BY` clause:
    - At present, you may only use direct column references in the `ORDER BY` clause.

## SQL Interface Sources

In the SQL Interface, there exist various schema providers, which all exist under the `chalk` catalog:

- `chalk.datasources`: directly query against the [data sources](/docs/integrations) configured in your
  environment (e.g. Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery, Iceberg, etc.). Table names are tables within the data sources themselves.

  **Schema**: Exactly that of the table in the data source.
- `chalk.historical_values`: query against historically observed feature values with table names of the form
  `feature_namespace.feature_name` from your offline store, or query for the freshest values for each primary key
  for a specific feature namespace with table names `feature_namespace`

  **Schema for `feature_namespace.feature_name`**:
    - `observation_id`, string, non-nullable: The unique identifier for the observation of the feature value.
    - `pkey`, (type of feature namespace's pkey), non-nullable: The value of the primary feature associated with this
      observation
    - `value`, (type of feature namespace's value): The observed value of the feature.
    - `value_json`, string, DEPRECATED: The observed value of the feature, as JSON, for backwards compatibility.
    - `observed_at`, timestamp, non-nullable: The time at which the feature value was observed.
    - `inserted_at`, timestamp, non-nullable: The time at which the feature value was inserted into the offline store.
    - `resolver_fqn`, string, nullable: The resolver that computed this feature.
    - `deployment_id`, string, nullable: The deployment id where the observation was made

  **Schema for `feature_namespace`**:
    - `__pkey__`: (type of feature namespace's pkey), non-nullable: The value of the primary feature associated with this row
    - `<feature-name>`, (type of feature), for each feature: The freshest observed value of the feature for the primary key.
    - `<feature-name>.__observed_at__`, timestamp, for each feature: The time at which the freshest value was observed.

- `chalk.query_log`:  A schema provider consisting of one table, `data`, which is the query log table.
  This table provides a list of query metadata for each operation id, including which tables in the offline store
  correspond to values queried in that operation id.
  **Schema for `data`**:
    - `operation_id`, string, non-nullable: The unique identifier for the operation.
    - `environment_id`, string, non-nullable: The environment id where the operation was run.
    - `deployment_id`, string: The deployment id where the operation was run.
    - `operation_kind`, string, The kind of operation that was run (inference, streaming, etc.).
    - `query_timestamp`, timestamp: The value of `now()` that was used by the query.
    - `execution_started_at`, timestamp: The time at which the operation started executing. Null if there were errors during planning.
    - `execution_finished_at`, timestamp: The time at which the operation finished executing. Null if there were errors during execution.
    - `query_status`, string: The status of the query (success, error, running, etc.).
    - `query_name`, string: The query name for named queries, null otherwise.
    - `query_name_version`, string: The version of the query for named queries, null otherwise.
    - `branch_name`: string: The branch the query was run on, null if the query was not run on a branch.
    - `correlation_id`, string: The correlation id for the query, null if the query was not run with a correlation id.
    - `value_tables`: array of strings: The list of tables in the offline store that correspond to result values from this query.
- `chalk.resolvers`: Trigger a resolver run and return the outputs of a specific resolver, with additional filtering
  based on the SQL query provided. A table exists for every eligible resolver. To run a resolver this way, it must not
  take any inputs and return a dataframe consisting of only scalar outputs.
  **Schema**: Exactly that of the resolver.

Chalk also offers a `chalk.information_schema` that you can query (similar to many other database offerings), and queries such as `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` can also be used.


## Examples
If you had the following feature class:

```py
@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
```

You could query observed feature values for `User.name` with `user.id = 1` by running the following query:

```sql
SELECT value FROM "chalk.historical_values.user.name" WHERE pkey = 1
```

## How complete is chalksql?

## How do I get data into chalksql?

Presently, ChalkSQL does will not materialize views or create persistent tables for you. If you would like to get your
own tables in, it is recommended to create a dataframe resolver that will return the data you need or insert a table
within one of your registered Data Sources and query it.

## High level workflows:

### How do I query the query log?

The query log is available as the `chalk.query_log.data` view in ChalkSQL.

TODO: Example of ChalkSQL for all Chalk queries for a specific query name+version.
TODO: Example of ChalkSQL to determine query success percentage over last 24 hours.

### How do I query historical feature values?



### How do I query my own datasources?

When you register a data source in your Chalk environment, it will appear as an **external catalog**. This catalog will
be named the same as the data source, and can be used as a direct view into that datasource.

TODO: Examples of joining across multiple datasources (federated query!)

The following data source types are presently supported and registered as external catalogs in ChalkSQL automatically:
- Postgres
- Spanner
- MySQL
- Clickhouse
- BigQuery
- Redshift
- Snowflake
- Databricks

### How do I query a resolver?

Dataframe resolvers *that do not take in inputs* are registered as views in ChalkSQL under
`chalk.resolver.<resolver-name>`. You may then treat them as any other view/table within your queries.

TODO: Example of ChalkSQL returning all results of a resolver with some filter, order-by, etc.

**Note: when defining resolvers in python, ChalkSQL will not be able to do pushdown into the view.** ChalkSQL will make
a best effort attempt to pushdown for dataframe SQL resolvers, however.

### How do I query my features?

ChalkSQL does not presently offer a way to query features from other features, like you would see in a conventional
online or offline query with Chalk. ChalkSQL does currently offer integration with these query endpoints by way
of providing
