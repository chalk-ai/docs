Computing features associated with third-party services can be unpredictably slow.
Chalk helps you manage such uncertainty by specifying a resolver timeout duration.

Chalk will instantaneously (&pm;1ms) cease waiting for a resolver whose
runtime has exceeded the specified timeout duration. Simultaneously,
via parallel execution, Chalk will return other crucial features whose
resolvers did not time out.

---

To specify a timeout, use the `timeout` keyword argument to either
`@online` or `@offline`:

## Example

```python
from chalk.features import online, offline

@online(timeout="200ms")
def resolve_australian_credit_score(
    driver_id: User.driver_id_aus,
) -> User.credit_score_aus:
    return experian_client.get_score(driver_id)

@offline(timeout=timedelta(milliseconds=50))
def resolve_canadian_credit_score(
    user_si_number: User.social_insurance_number,
) -> User.credit_score_can:
    return equifax_client.get_score(user_si_number)
```
See [Duration](/api-docs#Duration) for supported durations.

## Behavior upon timeout
### Direct timeout
If a query's output feature is directly resolved by a resolver that
timed out, Chalk will return an error with the error code `RESOLVER_TIMED_OUT`,
and its message will contain the name of the timed-out resolver.

### Upstream timeout
If a query's output feature is resolved by a resolver whose upstream
resolver has timed out, Chalk will return an error with the error
code `UPSTREAM_FAILED`.

The resolver that directly outputs the requested feature will not be
run (unless it marks its inputs as optional).

### Multiple output features
If your query contains multiple output features, Chalk will still
return the other features whose resolver did not time out.
