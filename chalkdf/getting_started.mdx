This guide will walk you through installing `chalkdf` and performing some basic operations.
If you are new to `chalkdf` or DataFrame libraries, this is a great place to start. If you
are already familiar with DataFrame libraries you can skip ahead to the full
[Reference Library](/dataframe-docs) or the [installation guide](/docs/chalkdf/installation)


## Installation

Given Python 3.10-3.13 and Linux/macOS 15+, you can install `chalkdf` via pip:

```bash
pip install chalkdf chalkpy
```

## Reading and Writing

`chalkdf` supports reading data from several formats and sources, including JSON, CSV, and Parquet files,
Arrow objects and tables, as well as AWS Glue Iceberg tables, and SQL sources defined via
`chalkpy`.

Below we can initialize a `chalkdf.DataFrame` from a Python dictionary.

```python
from chalkdf import DataFrame

df = DataFrame.from_dict(
    {
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
        "age": [25, 30, 35],
        "city": ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"],
    }
)

df.run()
```

```
DataFrame(materialized 3 rows x 3 columns)
Schema: name (string), age (int64), city (string)
Showing all rows:
name (string) | age (int64) | city (string)
--------------+-------------+--------------
Alice         | 25          | New York
Bob           | 30          | Los Angeles
Charlie       | 35          | Chicago
```

You can also scan files directly into a DataFrame. Below, we scan a CSV file:

```python
from chalkdf import DataFrame

```
