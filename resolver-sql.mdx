description: What are sql resolvers.

SQL resolvers are a way to pull data from your data sources into your
feature sets.

Below, is a simple example of a sql resolver that pulls a user's name,
birthday, and email from a `users` table in a postgres database. The example
assumes that a Postgres integration has been added to your Chalk environment
with the name `pg_user`.

```
from chalk.features import features, online

@features
class ChalkUser:
    id: str
    name: str
    birthday: date
    email: str
```

```sql src/user.chalk.sql
-- The features given to us by the user.
-- resolves: user
-- source: pg_user
select
    id,
    full_name as name,
    birthday,
    email
from users;
```

In this section we'll go through [how to specify inputs](#inputs) to your sql
resolvers, [how to specify outputs](#outputs), and [how to specify run conditons](#run-conditions).

## Inputs

SQL resolvers do not take Feature Sets as inputs. Instead, they require a
data source, which the SQL query defined in the resolver runs against. As
seen in the example above, the datasource for the sql resolver is specified
using a comment, like so: `-- source: pg_user`. If you have only a single
data source of a specific type (for instance, postgres in this example) you
can also use the type of the data source as its source, like so: `-- source: postgres`.

## Outputs

To specify the output of a SQL resolver, you also use a comment, like so:
`--resolves: ChalkUser`. You can either use Pascal Case or snake_case for
the feature set name: `--resolves: chalk_user` would also work.

## Run Conditions

Like python resolvers, SQL resolvers are either online or offline. To specify
the type of resolver, you use a comment, like so: `-- type: online` or
`-- type: offline`. You can omit the type, and your sql resolver will default
to being an online resolver.

### Scheduling SQL Resolvers

SQL resolvers can be scheduled to run at a specific time using the `-- cron: 5m`.
Here `5m` can be any [Chalk Duration](/docs/duration), including a cron expression.
