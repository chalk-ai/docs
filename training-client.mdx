Offline queries pull data from the offline store or calculate features through
[resolvers that are marked as offline](/docs/resolver-online-offline).

<TipInfo>
    Offline queries can also execute online resolvers if no offline resolver is available for a
    requested feature.
</TipInfo>

In an offline query you can request features for multiple entities at distinct time points.
By default, an offline query returns a row for each primary key containing the most recent
computed value for each requested output feature. The main use case for offline queries is
creating datasets.

Chalk supports a number of clients that can run offline queries. In this section, our examples
focus on our python client, which integrates nicely with jupyter notebooks.

## Making Offline Queries

As mentioned earlier, offline queries can be made through one of Chalk's API clients.

```python
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
dataset = client.offline_query(
    input_sql='''
      select
          user_id as "user.id",
          created_at as __ts__
      from "datasources.postgres.fraud_events"
      order by created_at desc
      limit 30
    ''',
    output=[
        User.name,
        User.denylisted,
        User.name_email_match_score,
        User.domain_name,
        User.email_username,
        User.credit_report.percent_past_due,
    ],
    recompute_features=True,
)
df = dataset.to_pandas()
```

In the Python client, offline queries return Chalk `Dataset`s, which we cover, in detail, in the
next [section](/docs/datasets). However, at a high level, Chalk `Dataset`s are flexible wrappers
around the results of your offline query that can be converted to pandas or polars—this makes them
easy to use for downstream ML tasks.

### Input

As input, [offline_query](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query) supports:

- [input](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input) with [chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe) or [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
- mappings from feature FQNs to value lists
- [input_sql](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input_sql) for Chalk SQL-driven inputs

Regardless of input format, the primary key feature must be included.

Alternatively, instead of a `DataFrame`, users can pass a mapping from features to a list of values for each feature.

```python
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id2'],
    User.age: [23, 40]
}
```

### Input Times

Timestamps can be also be passed in the [input_times](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input_times) argument instead.

```py
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id1'],
}
input_times=[datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1), datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)]
```

### Output

This argument describes a list of features to sample.

```py
output=[
    User.returned_transactions_last_60,
    User.user_account_name_match_score,
    User.socure_score,
    User.identity.has_verified_phone,
    User.identity.is_voip_phone,
    User.identity.account_age_days,
    User.identity.email_age,
]
```

### Recompute Features

Users can request that certain features be recomputed by resolvers
at query time instead of sampled from the offline store.
For more information, read [here](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.recompute_features).

### Time Bounds

In some cases, users may not have a list of primary keys to sample with,
and instead would like to see results within a period of time.
The user can then leave the `inputs` argument empty and supply a
[lower bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.lower_bound) and an
[upper bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.upper_bound) along with the requested output features.

```py
dataset: Dataset = ChalkClient().offline_query(
     output=[
         User.id,
         User.fullname,
         User.email,
         User.name_email_match_score,
     ],
     lower_bound=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
     upper_bound=datetime.now(),
)
```

### Environment

The user can specify
[tags](/docs/resolver-tags),
[environment](/docs/resolver-environments),
or [branch](/docs/branches)
as parameters to `offline_query` in the same fashion
as [online query](/docs/query-basics).
