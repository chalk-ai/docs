Offline queries pull data from the offline store or calculate features through
[resolvers that are marked as offline](/docs/resolver-offline-online).

<TipInfo>
  Offline queries can also execute online resolvers if no offline resolver is available for a
  requested feature.
</TipInfo>

In an offline query you can request multiple instances of a feature set. Additionally, by default,
an offline query returns all matches for a primary key in the offline store. For instance, if you
requested the `num_transactions` feature for users with id's `1`, `2`, or `3`, you could receive
multiple rows for each user if you've computed the `num_transactions` feature for each user multiple
times.

The main use cases for offline queries is creating datasets.

Chalk supports a number of client that can run offline queries. In this section, our examples focus
on our python client, which integrates nicely with jupyter notebooks.

## Making Offline Queries

As mentioned earlier, offline queries can be made through one of Chalk's API
clients.

```python
from chalk.client import ChalkClient
from datetime import datetime

client = ChalkClient()
client.offline_query(
  input={'user.id': [1,2,3,4]},         # Input
  output=['user.name'],                 # Output
  # tags=['test'],                      # Environment
  # branch='branch',
  # recompute_features=True,            # Run Resolvers
  # run_async=True,                     # Run Configuration
  # max_samples = 10,
  # lower_bound=datetime(2024, 10, 12), # Bounds
  # upper_bound=datetime(2024, 10, 20),
)
```

In the Python client, offline queries return Chalk `Dataset`s, which we cover, in detail, in the
next [section](/docs/datasets). However, at a high level, Chalk `Dataset`s are flexible wrappers
around the results of your offline query that can be converted to pandas or polarsâ€”this makes them
easy to use for downstream ML tasks.

### Input

As [input](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input), `offline_query` takes a
[chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe) or [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
with one column for each known feature in the input, and one column
with the heading of `chalk.features.timestamp`.
The primary key feature must be included among the inputs.

The values of the `chalk.features.timestamp` field should be of type
`datetime.datetime`. If the timestamp column is omitted, it is defaulted to `datetime.now()`.
More discussion about the timestamp inputs
can be found in the [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency) section.

Alternatively, instead of a `DataFrame`, users can pass a mapping from features to a list of values for each feature.

```python
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id2'],
    User.age: [23, 40]
}
```

### Input Times

Timestamps can be also be passed in the [input_times](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input_times) argument instead.

```py
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id1'],
}
input_times=[datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1), datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)]
```

### Output

This argument describes a list of features to sample.

```py
output=[
    User.returned_transactions_last_60,
    User.user_account_name_match_score,
    User.socure_score,
    User.identity.has_verified_phone,
    User.identity.is_voip_phone,
    User.identity.account_age_days,
    User.identity.email_age,
]
```

### Recompute Features

Users can request that certain features be recomputed by resolvers
at query time instead of sampled from the offline store.
For more information, read [here](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.recompute_features).

### Timebounds

In some cases, users may not have a list of primary keys to sample with,
and instead would like to see results within a period of time.
The user can then leave the `inputs` argument empty and supply a
[lower bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.lower_bound) and an
[upper bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.upper_bound) along with the requested output features.

```py
dataset: Dataset = ChalkClient().offline_query(
     output=[
         User.id,
         User.fullname,
         User.email,
         User.name_email_match_score,
     ],
     lower_bound=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
     upper_bound=datetime.now(),
)
```

### Environment

The user can specify
[tags](/docs/resolver-tags),
[environment](/docs/resolver-environments),
or [branch](/docs/branches)
as parameters to `offline_query` in the same fashion
as [online query](/docs/query-basics).
