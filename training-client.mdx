Chalk supports a Python client for sampling offline data for use in training or feature development.
This client can be used directly in a Jupyter notebook:

<JupyterNotebook />

The client for querying offline data largely mirrors the
contract for [querying data online](/docs/query-basics).
Here, however, we return many rows of data instead of data
for a single example.

## API

Offline data is accessed via the class
`chalk.ChalkClient`.
Authentication is handled by the Chalk CLI tool.
So long as the machine you're using is authenticated
to Chalk, no API tokens or client secrets are needed
for use in a notebook.

The `ChalkClient` exposes a method
`offline_query`,
which takes in
input features (`input`),
desired features to compute (`output`), and
information about the environment (`environment`),
and returns a [Dataset](/docs/datasets)
which includes the requested features.
For more information, see the documentation for Chalk's [Python Client](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query).

### Input

As [input](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input), `offline_query` takes a
[chalk.DataFrame](/docs/dataframe)
or
[pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
with one column for each known feature in the input, and one column
with the heading of `chalk.features.timestamp`.
The primary key feature must be included among the inputs.

The values of the `chalk.features.timestamp` field should be of type
`datetime.datetime`. If the timestamp column is omitted, it is defaulted to `datetime.now()`.
More discussion about the timestamp inputs
can be found in the [temporal consistency](/docs/temporal-consistency) section.

Alternatively, instead of a `DataFrame`, users can pass a mapping from features to a list of values for each feature.

```py
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id2'],
    User.age: [23, 40]
}
```

### Input Times

Timestamps can be also be passed in the [input_times](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.input_times) argument instead.

```py
input={
    User.id: ['id1', 'id1'],
}
input_times=[datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1), datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)]
```

### Output

This argument describes a list of features to sample.

```py
output=[
    User.returned_transactions_last_60,
    User.user_account_name_match_score,
    User.socure_score,
    User.identity.has_verified_phone,
    User.identity.is_voip_phone,
    User.identity.account_age_days,
    User.identity.email_age,
]
```

### Recompute Features

Users can request that certain features be recomputed by resolvers
at query time instead of sampled from the offline store.
For more information, read [here](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.recompute_features).

### Timebounds

In some cases, users may not have a list of primary keys to sample with,
and instead would like to see results within a period of time.
The user can then leave the `inputs` argument empty and supply a
[lower bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.lower_bound) and an
[upper bound](/api-docs#ChalkClient.offline_query.upper_bound) along with the requested output features.

```py
dataset: Dataset = ChalkClient().offline_query(
     output=[
         User.id,
         User.fullname,
         User.email,
         User.name_email_match_score,
     ],
     lower_bound=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
     upper_bound=datetime.now(),
)
```

### Environment

The user can specify
[tags](/docs/resolver-tags),
[environment](/docs/resolver-environments),
or [branch](/docs/branches)
as parameters to `offline_query` in the same fashion
as [online query](/docs/query-basics).

### Query Explanation

Chalk offers support for the user for when queries don't work.
The first step is always to check to see the response contains any `errors`.
Often, the error message will directly point to the failure.

In the case of more complicated queries, queries can be sent with `explain=True`.
This will return a representation of the query plan in the `meta` return attribute.
The user can use this information to verify the resolvers and operators ran during execution.
Beware, this will result in slower execution times.

Some queries that involve multiple operations might need additional tracking.
Users can supply `store_plan_stages=True` to store intermediate outputs at all operations of the query.
This will dramatically slow things down, so use wisely!
These results are visible in the dashboard under the "Queries" page.

### Return Value

The return value for `offline_query` is a Chalk `Dataset`,
which is described in the next [section](/docs/datasets).
