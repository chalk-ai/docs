description: Track and manage named queries in Chalk

With Chalk [NamedQuery](/api-docs#NamedQuery) objects, you can define and version
your common query patterns in code. This provides a few advantages:
- queries are preplanned on engine boot, reducing first-query latency,
- query outputs and parameters don't need to be hardcoded, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistency between your queries,
- queries are grouped together on the web, making them easier to track, monitor, and debug.

## Defining a NamedQuery

To define a named query, add a `NamedQuery` object to your Chalk deployment:

```python
from chalk import NamedQuery
from src.feature_sets import Book, Author

NamedQuery(
    name="book_key_information",
    input=[Book.id],
    output=[
        Book.id,
        Book.title,
        Book.author.name,
        Book.year,
        Book.short_description
    ],
    tags=["team:analytics"],
    staleness={
        Book.short_description: "0s"
    },
    owner="mary.shelley@aol.com",
    description=(
        "Return a condensed view of a book, including its title, author, "
        "year, and short description."
    )
)
```

Running `chalk apply` makes the named query available in your deployment.

## Using Named Queries

Named queries can then be leveraged through any of our clients by specifying the `query_name` parameter.

Using the Chalk CLI tool, this looks something like:

```sh
chalk query --in book.id=1 --query-name book_key_information
```

Because a named query has been specified, you don't need to explicitly pass in the tags and outputs
for your query. The above command is equivalent to running the more complicated:
```sh
chalk query --in book.id=1 \
  --out book.id \
  --out book.title \
  --out book.author \
  --out book.year \
  --out book.author.name \
  --out book.short_description \
  --staleness book.short_description=0s \
  --tags team:analytics
```

This feature is also accessible in all of our API clients through the `query_name` parameter.
For instance, in python, you can run:

```python
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()

client.query(
    input={"book.id": 1},
    query_name="book_key_information",
)
```
To see all the named queries you've defined in your current active deployment, you can run:

```sh
chalk named-query list
```

## Versioning Named Queries

If you want to create multiple versions of a similar query, you can use the [version](/api-docs#NamedQuery.__init__.version) parameter of the NamedQuery object
and the [query_name_version](/api-docs#ChalkClient.query.query_name_version) parameter of our various clients.

Note, when executing a named query both the query name and the query version must match.
This means that if you've defined four named queries in your codebase:

```python
from chalk import NamedQuery
from src.feature_sets import Book

first_nq = NamedQuery(name="book_id", input=[Book.id], output=[Book.id])
second_nq = NamedQuery(name="book_id", input=[Book.id], version=1, output=[Book.name])
third_nq = NamedQuery(name="book_id", input=[Book.id], version=2, output=[Book.author])
fourth_nq = NamedQuery(name="book_id", input=[Book.id], version=3, output=[Book.version])
```
And you run the following query:
```sh
chalk query --in book.id=1 --query-name book_id
```
We will return `Book.id` since the first named query has no version and no version was passed
through `query-name-version`. Currently, to access a version named query, the version must be
explicitly passed. For example:
```sh
chalk query --in book.id=1 --query-name book_id --query-name-version 1
```
