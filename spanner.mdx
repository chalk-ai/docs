Chalk supports [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/?hl=en) as a natively accelerated [SQL source](/docs/sql).

## Adding Spanner

Follow the [GCP instructions](/docs/gcp) to give Chalk access to application credentials for your GCP account. Chalk
will use these credentials to access Spanner. On the dashboard, you can plug in the configuration for your
Spanner database:

<AddSpannerIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />


## Single Integration

Add your Spanner data source in a Python file and give it a `name`. This line is required for all Spanner
integrations. In this file, we'll also define a `User` feature class with a `transaction_volume` feature which will be
resolved with Spanner.

If you have only one Spanner connection that you'd like
to add to Chalk, you do not need to specify any arguments
to construct the source in your code.

```py
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import SpannerSource

spanner_source = SpannerSource()

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float
```

## Multiple Integrations

<span>{getNamedIntegrationText()}</span>

```py
from chalk.sql import SpannerSource

spanner_source_txns = SpannerSource(name="**SPANNER_TRANSACTIONS**")
spanner_source_marketing = SpannerSource(name="**SPANNER_MARKETING**")

```

Now, you are all set to use Spanner with [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers).

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: SPANNER_TRANSACTIONS
SELECT
    id,
    TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume
FROM
    UserTable
LIMIT 10
```

This file resolves the `User.transaction_volume` feature. Please note that the `--source: my_spanner` line is necessary
and should match the `name` provided to your [`SpannerSource`](/api-docs#SpannerSource). If you have a single integration,
you should use the name that is defined in the dashboard.
