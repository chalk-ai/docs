Chalk supports [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/?hl=en) as a natively accelerated [SQL source](/docs/sql).

## Adding DynamoDB

Follow the [GCP instructions](/docs/gcp) to give Chalk access to application credentials for your GCP account. Chalk
will use these credentials to access Spanner.

## Integration

Add your Spanner data source in a Python file and give it a `name`. This line is required for all Spanner
integrations. In this file, we'll also define a `User` feature class with a `transaction_volume` feature which will be
resolved with Spanner.

```python
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import SpannerSource

SpannerSource(name="my_spanner")  # required for Chalk to be aware of this source

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float
```

Now, you are all set to use Spanner with [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers):

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: my_spanner
SELECT
    id,
    TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume
FROM
    UserTable
LIMIT 10
```

This file resolves the `User.transaction_volume` feature. Please note that the `--source: my_spanner` line is necessary
and should match the `name` provided to your [`SpannerSource`](/api-docs#SpannerSource).
