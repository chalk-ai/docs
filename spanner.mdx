Chalk supports [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/?hl=en) as a natively accelerated [SQL source](/docs/sql).

## Adding Spanner

Follow the [GCP instructions](/docs/gcp) to give Chalk access to application credentials for your GCP account. Chalk
will use these credentials to access Spanner. On the dashboard, you can plug in the configuration for your
Spanner database:

<AddSpannerIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

## Integrations Setup

After configuring your Spanner integration in the dashboard, define your data sources in Python:

```py
from chalk.sql import SpannerSource

spanner_source_txns = SpannerSource(name="SPANNER_TRANSACTIONS")
spanner_source_marketing = SpannerSource(name="SPANNER_MARKETING")
```

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `SPANNER_TRANSACTIONS` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: SPANNER_TRANSACTIONS
SELECT
    id,
    TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume
FROM
    UserTable
```

And to query from the `SPANNER_MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: SPANNER_MARKETING
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    campaign_status
FROM
    MarketingTable
```
