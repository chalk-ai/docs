Chalk supports [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) as a [SQL source](/docs/sql). This allows users to load data from
their AWS Glue and other AWS data sources (Hive, DocumentDB, Iceberg, etc.) directly into Chalk features.

## Adding Athena

In the settings page, you'll find a form for adding your credentials. Note that we will perform data unload operations
to the provided staging directory in S3: these intermediate results will appear under the `chalk-unload` folder.

<AddAthenaIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

## Single Integration

Add your Athena data source in a Python file and give it a `name`. This line is required for all Athen
integrations. In this file, we'll also define a `User` feature class with a `transaction_volume` feature which will be
resolved with Athena.

If you have only one Athena connection that you'd like
to add to Chalk, you do not need to specify any arguments
to construct the source in your code.

```py
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import AthenaSource

athena_source = AthenaSource()

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float
```

## Multiple Integrations

<span>{getNamedIntegrationText()}</span>

```py
from chalk.sql import AthenaSource

athena_source_txns = AthenaSource(name="**ATHENA_TRANSACTIONS**")
athena_source_marketing = AthenaSource(name="**ATHENA_MARKETING**")
```

Then, access the Athena source in your resolvers. Note that all queries to Athena will be run with [UNLOAD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/unload.html) to handle
larger-than-memory datasets.

```py
from chalk import offline, DataFrame
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import AthenaSource

athena_source = AthenaSource()

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float

@offline
def get_transactions() -> DataFrame[User]:
    return athena_source.query_string(
        """
        SELECT
            id,
            transaction_volume
        FROM
            transactions
        """,
        fields={
            "id": User.id,
            "transaction_volume": User.transaction_volume,
        }
    ).all()
```
