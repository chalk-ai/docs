Chalk supports [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) as a [SQL source](/docs/sql). This allows users to load data from
AWS Glue and other AWS data sources (Hive, DocumentDB, Iceberg, etc.) directly into Chalk features.

## Adding Athena

In the settings page, you'll find a form for adding your credentials. Note that we will perform data unload operations
to the provided staging directory in S3: these intermediate results will appear under the `chalk-unload` folder.

## Integrations Setup

After configuring your Athena integration in the dashboard, define your data sources in Python:

```py
from chalk.sql import AthenaSource

athena_source_txns = AthenaSource(name="ATHENA_TRANSACTIONS")
athena_source_marketing = AthenaSource(name="ATHENA_MARKETING")
```

Note that all queries to Athena will be run with [UNLOAD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/unload.html) to handle larger-than-memory datasets.

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `ATHENA_TRANSACTIONS` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: ATHENA_TRANSACTIONS
SELECT id, transaction_volume FROM transactions
```

And to query from the `ATHENA_MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: ATHENA_MARKETING
SELECT id, email, campaign_status FROM marketing_data
```
