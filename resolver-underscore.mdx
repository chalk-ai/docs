title: Underscore
description: Using underscore expressions to define features
---

Underscore expressions can be used to define and resolve features
inline in your feature sets, from operations on sibling features.

## Example

Consider the feature class `RocketEngine` define below:

```python
from chalk.features import features

@features
class RocketEngine:
    id: int
    mass: float
    thrust: float
```

Suppose we wanted to define a feature called `density` and resolve it as `mass / volume`.
We can use the underscore feature definition syntax as follows:

```diff-py
- from chalk.features import features
+ from chalk.features import _, features

@features
class RocketEngine:
    id: int
    mass: float
    thrust: float

+   # Defining density using an underscore expression
+   density: float = _.mass / _.volume
```

Note that `_` is a reference to the containing feature class `RocketEngine` and should
be used to reference features contained in the same feature class.



---

## DataFrames

Underscore can also be used to define expressions with [`DataFrame`](/docs/dataframe) features.

In the example below, we will define two new feature classes `Astronaut` and `RocketShip`

```python
from chalk.features import features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Astronaut:
    id: int
    name: str
    height: float
    mass: float
    ship_id: int

@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)
```
### Projections

Suppose we wanted to define a feature called `total_mass` on `RocketShip` and resolve
it as the sum of the masses of the astronauts on the ship and the mass of the engine.

Using the underscore syntax, we can define `total_mass` as follows

```diff-py
- from chalk.features import features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame
+ from chalk.features import _, features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Astronaut:
    id: int
    name: str
    height: float
    mass: float
    ship_id: int

@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)

+   # Defining total_mass using an underscore expression
+   total_mass: float = _.engine.mass + _.astronauts[_.mass].sum()
```

Here we used the underscore syntax do a [projection](/docs/dataframe#projections) of the `mass` column in the
astronauts `DataFrame`.


### Filters

Underscores can also be used to define [filters](/docs/dataframe#filters) on `DataFrame` features.

For example, suppose we wanted to define a feature called `count_tall_astronauts` on `RocketShip`.
We could define the feature as follows

```diff-py
@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)

    # Defining total_mass using an underscore expression
    total_mass: float = _.engine.mass + _.astronauts[_.mass].sum()

+   # Filtering on the `height` column
+   count_tall_astronauts = _.astronauts[_.height > 2.0].count()
```
