## Mypy plugin

*** Chalk now recommends using [`chalk stubgen`](/cli/stubgen) tool over the MyPy plugin. ***

<p>
  Chalk extensively uses the Python type system to allow you to naturally express your feature
  pipelines. Chalk's type annotations and feature set constructors are not natively supported by
  editors, which can trigger{' '}
  <span class="underline decoration-wavy decoration-accent-yellow">warnings</span> and{' '}
  <span class="outline outline-1 outline-offset-2 outline-accent-red">errors</span> in your
  development environment.
</p>

Fortunately, Chalk ships with a mypy plugin for providing
advanced support and type checking for your feature pipelines.
We support mypy via its plugin system.

### Installation

At the root of your project, create a file called mypy.ini
with the following contents:

```ini mypy.ini
[mypy]
plugins = chalk.mypy_plugin
```

(if you created your project with the Chalk CLI, this will
have been done for you already.)

You also need to install a mypy plugin for your editor.
For example, for PyCharm and IntelliJ, we recommend
the [Mypy Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11086-mypy).

## Plugin capabilities

### Incomplete feature sets

<TipGood>Return only part of a feature set from a resolver.</TipGood>

```python
@features
class UserFeatures:
    name: str
    bday: str
    age: int


def incomplete_set() -> Features[UserFeatures.name, UserFeatures.age]:
    # We're omitting `age` and returning only `name` and `bday`
    return UserFeatures(name="joseph", age=34)
```

Chalk allows you to return only a subset of the fields
for a particular feature set.
In the above example, `UserFeatures` contains three fields,
but our resolver returns only two of them.
Our plugin converts

- `UserFeatures(name=..., bday=...)` to
- `Features[UserFeatures.name, UserFeatures.bday]`

---

### Unordered output

<TipGood>Specified the returned features in any order.</TipGood>

```python
def unordered_output() -> Features[UserFeatures.age, UserFeatures.name]:
    # Order of arguments need not line up. `Features` is treated as a set.
    return UserFeatures(name="joseph", age=34)
```

In this example, we have flipped the order of the arguments
in the type signature from the order of the arguments given to
`UserFeatures`. Because the plugin sorts the types before comparing,
this example is also valid.

---

### Type-mismatch on features

<TipBad>Recognize when you're returning the wrong features.</TipBad>

```python
def name_age_bad() -> Features[UserFeatures.name, UserFeatures.age]:
    # We're getting Features[name, bday] and expected Features[name, age]
    return UserFeatures(name="4", bday="")
```

Chalk can check that the subset of features returned from a function
match the intended returned features. This example results in the
following error message:

```bash
error: Incompatible return value type:
         Received: Features[bday, name]
         Expected: Features[age,  name]
```

Here, we're returning the `UserFeatures.name` and `UserFeatures.bday`
features, but we expected to have the `UserFeatures.age` feature
instead of the `UserFeatures.bday` feature.

---

### Feature value type checking

<TipBad>Check that feature values receive correct types.</TipBad>

```python
def name_bad_type() -> Features[UserFeatures.name]:
    # Knows that name should be a string, not an int
    return UserFeatures(name=4)
```

Mypy surfaces the following error for this example:

```bash
error: Argument "name" to "UserFeatures" has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"
```

Here, `UserFeatures.name` should be given as a `string`,
but we have instead supplied an `int`.

### Constructor arguments

<TipBad>Check arguments to constructor of feature sets.</TipBad>

```python
UserFeatures(bogus_field=4)
```

Mypy surfaces the following error for this example:

```bash
error: Unexpected keyword argument "bogus_field" for "UserFeatures"
```

`UserFeatures.bogus_field` is not a feature on the `UserFeatures`
class, and so cannot be used in the `__init__` method.
