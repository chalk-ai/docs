## Standard Support

All customers can create support tickets through Slack by starting a new thread and adding the 🎫 ticket reaction.
Our team responds to tickets during standard business hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM PST).

## Enterprise Support

We provide additional production support for plans on Enterprise Support. This allows paging our on-call engineers 24/7
via pagerduty for any outage.

### Paging via the dashboard

Paging via the dashboard can be achieved by clicking your username at the bottom left, then escalate issue.
A modal will open that allows you to provide more information regarding the incident.

### Paging via Slack

If a ticket is created via Slack by adding the ticket reaction, a message will appear with
an option to select the priority.

If Urgent is selected in the previous message, another option appears with the ability to page us.

<img src="/img/page-form.png" alt="Page Form" style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

### Paging via email

Enterprise support customers are given an emergency email address. Each message sent to this address immediately
pages our on-call engineering team.
