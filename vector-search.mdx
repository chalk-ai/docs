A feature set can be linked to the closest examples of another feature set. This functionality can be useful for search
and retrieval applications.

Nearest neighbor relationships are only supported for [vector features](/docs/feature-types#vectors).

<TipInfo>
  We recommend to first take a look through Chalk's support for <a href="/docs/feature-types#vectors">vector
  features</a> and <a href="/docs/embeddings">embedding functions</a>.
</TipInfo>


To illustrate how to use nearest neighbor relationships, we'll walk through an example for Chalk can power FAQ search.
In this example, the feature set `SearchQuery` feature set represents an incoming request, and the `FAQDocument`
feature set represents our collection of frequently asked questions and answers. Our goal is to return the five most
relevant FAQ entries for the given search query.

## Defining nearest neighbor relationships
Using the `has_many` function and the `is_near` method, we can express a relationship where we want the nearest
documents for each query.

```py
from chalk.features import DataFrame, features, embedding, has_many, Vector

@features
class SearchQuery:
  query: str
  product_version: int
  embedding: Vector = embedding(...)
  nearest_documents: DataFrame[FAQDocument] = has_many(lambda: SearchQuery.embedding.is_near(FAQDocument.embedding))
  response: str

@features
class FAQDocument:
  question: str
  product_version: int
  question_embedding: Vector = embedding(...)
  link: str
```

<TipInfo>
  The <code>lambda</code> solves forward references, letting you reference <code>SearchQuery</code> and
  <code>FAQDocument</code> before they are defined.
</TipInfo>

### Distance Measure

Nearest neighbor relationships use a distance function to measure closeness. By default, Chalk uses L2 distance, though
inner product and cosine similarity are also supported. To change the distance function, use the `distance` argument:

```py
from chalk.features import DataFrame, features, has_many

@features
class SearchQuery:
  nearest_documents: DataFrame[Document] = has_many(
    lambda: SearchQuery.embedding.is_near(
      FAQDocument.embedding,
      distance="cosine",  # or "inner product"
    )
  )
```


### Indexing

By default, Chalk indexes nearest-neighbor relationships with hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) graphs.
Compared to linear search,
HNSW has lower algorithmic complexity and thereby significantly better performance when querying a relationship with
many examples. However, unlike other indexing strategies,
HNSW is trades recall for performance. If perfect recall is required, you can set the `index=None` parameter when
defining the relationship.

```py
from chalk.features import DataFrame, features, has_many

@features
class SearchQuery:
  nearest_documents: DataFrame[Document] = has_many(
    lambda: SearchQuery.embedding.is_near(FAQDocument.embedding, index=None)
  )
```

## Nearest neighbors as resolver inputs

It's possible to use this relationship as a [resolver input](/docs/resolver-inputs#vector-dependencies). The resulting
documents will be returned  as a [Chalk DataFrame](/docs/dataframe). Because the search is approximate, the number of
documents to return *must* be specified via a slice expression.

```py
from chalk import online

@online
def generate_response(
  # Query for the five most relevant documents, and select their links
  nearest_documents: SearchQuery.nearest_documents[FAQDocument.link, :5],
) -> SearchQuery.response:
  return "\n".join(nearest_documents[FAQDocument.link])
```

### Filtering

Inside the input argument signature, we can include filters for more accurate results. The filters will be applied
_before_ the limit is applied.

**When using a nearest neighbor relationship, do not filter within the resolver.**

Filtering inside the resolver will be performed _after_ the limit is applied, which may filter out all returned neighbors
if none of them match the filter expression.

<TipBad>Don't filter like this</TipBad>

```py
from chalk import online

@online
def generate_response(
  version: SearchQuery.product_version,
  nearest_documents: SearchQuery.nearest_documents[
    FAQDocument.link,
    FAQDocument.product_version,
    :5,
  ],
) -> SearchQuery.response:
  # Don't do this! If the nearest five documents are all for a different product version,
  # then filtered_nearest_documents will be empty
  filtered_nearest_documents = nearest_documents[FAQDocument.product_version == version]
  return "\n".join(filtered_nearest_documents[FAQDocument.link])
```

Instead, specify the filter conditions in the resolver signature. This will ensure that the filter is applied _before_
the limit, meaning that the nearest five documents that much all of the filters will be returned.

<TipGood>Filter like this</TipGood>

```py
from chalk import online

@online
def generate_response(
  filtered_nearest_documents: SearchQuery.nearest_documents[
    FAQDocument.link,
    FAQDocument.product_version == SearchQuery.product_version,
    :5,
  ],
) -> SearchQuery.response:
  return "\n".join(filtered_nearest_documents[FAQDocument.link])
```
