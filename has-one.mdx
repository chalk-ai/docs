Has-one relationships link a feature to a single instance of another feature.

## Recommended Implementation

Below is the simplest way to specify a join for a has-one relationship. In the example below,
a `User` is linked to their `Profile`.

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class Profile:
    id: str
    user_id: "User.id"
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    profile: Profile
```

With a has-one relationship established, you can reference features on `Profile` through
`User`. For example:

```py
user_email_age = User.profile.email_age_years
```

## Explicit Join

In the following snippet, the has-one join is explicitly defined. This is functionally
equivalent to the recommended implementation:

```py
from chalk.features import features, has_one, ...

@features
class Profile:
    id: str
    user_id: str
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    uid: str
    profile: Profile = has_one(lambda: Profile.user_id == User.uid)
```

<TipInfo>
  The `lambda` solves forward references, letting you reference `User` before you defined it.
</TipInfo>

## Back-references

### One-to-one

You can also add a back-reference to `User` from `Profile`.
However, you don't have to explicitly set the join on `Profile`.
Instead, the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over.
To complete the one-to-one relationship from our example,  add a `User`
to the `Profile` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={oneToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

### Optional relationships

You can define optional relationships by using the `typing.Optional[...]` keyword:

<PyDiffEditor html={hasOneOptionalDiff} />
