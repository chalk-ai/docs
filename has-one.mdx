Has-one relationships link a feature to a single instance of another feature.

## Recommended Implementation

The simplest way to specify a join for a has-one relationship is implicitly. In the example below,
a `User` is linked to their `Profile`.

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class Profile:
    id: str
    user_id: "User.id"
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    profile: Profile
```

With a has-one relationship established, you can reference features on `Profile` through
`User`. For example:

```py
user_email_age = User.profile.email_age_years
```

## Explicit Join

In the following snippet, the has-one join is explicitly defined. This is functionally
equivalent to the recommended implementation:

```py
from chalk.features import features, has_one, ...

@features
class Profile:
    id: str
    user_id: str
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    id: str
    uid: str
    profile: Profile = has_one(lambda: Profile.user_id == User.uid)
```

<TipInfo>
  The <code>lambda</code> solves forward references, letting you reference <code>User</code> before it is defined.
</TipInfo>

### Composite Join Keys

You can also specify a composite join key for a has-one relationship. For example, if a `User` is linked to a
`Profile` by `org` and `email`, you can define the join as follows:

```python
from chalk.features import features, has_one
from datetime import datetime

@features
class User:
    id: str
    email: str = _.alias + "-" + _.org + _.domain
    org_domain: str = _.org + _.domain
    org: str
    domain: str
    alias: str

    # join with composite key
    posts: DataFrame[Posts] = has_many(lambda: User.email == Post.email)
    # multi-feature join
    org_profile: Profile = has_one(lambda: (User.alias == Profile.email) & (User.org == Profile.org))

@features
class Workspace:
    id: str
    # join with child-class's composite key
    users: DataFrame[Users] = has_many(lambda: Workspace.id == User.org_domain)
```

---

## Back-references

### One-to-one

You can also add a back-reference to `User` from `Profile`.
However, you don't have to explicitly set the join on `Profile`.
Instead, the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over.
To complete the one-to-one relationship from our example, add a `User`
to the `Profile` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={oneToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

### Optional relationships

When a has-one relationship is specified, the default behavior is to treat the linked Feature
as required. Following the example above, specifying a `User` without a `Profile` and
querying for a `User`'s profile or using the `User.profile` in a resolver raises an
error.

To define optional relationships, use the `typing.Optional[...]` keyword:

<PyDiffEditor html={hasOneOptionalDiff} />

Note, resolvers that take optional features as inputs need to handle the `None` case. This is
covered in more detail in [the resolver's section of the docs](/docs/python-resolvers#optional-has-one).

## Chained Has-One Joins

You can chain has-one joins to traverse multiple relationships. For example, you could define
the following features to represent a user's profile and preferences in an application.

```python
from chalk.features import features, Primary

@features
class User:
    id: str
    email: str

@features
class Profile:
    id: Primary[User.id]
    username: str

@features
class Preferences:
    id: Primary[Profile.id]
    dark_mode: bool


```

## Organizing Feature Definitions Across Files

In larger projects, it's common to split feature definitions across multiple Python modules.
For unidirectional dependencies, this is straightforward. For example, if `user.py` imports
`profile.py`, you can define the `User` and `Profile` features in separate files without
issues. However, if you have circular dependencies, you may run into problems.

Chalk supports this, but circular imports can arise when features reference each other across files.
To avoid these issues, use the `if TYPE_CHECKING` block from the `typing` module and quote your forward references.

Here's an example of how to do this cleanly:

```python src/profile.py
# Imports User directly, because user.py
# wont import profile.py
from src.user import User

@features
class Profile:
    id: Primary[User.id]
    username: str
```

```python src/user.py
from chalk.features import features
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Imports Profile only when type checking
    # to avoid circular imports
    from src.profile import Profile

@features
class User:
    id: str
    # Profile must be quoted because it is imported
    # only when type checking
    profile: "Profile"
```

By quoting imports inside `if TYPE_CHECKING`,
you avoid circular dependency errors while still
maintaining type safety and feature linkage.

## Querying for Has-One Relationships

You can also query for a feature that is joined through a has-one relationship by
referencing the root namespace. For example, to query for the `Profile` features
associated with a `User` continuing from the example above, you can write:

```python
from chalk.client import ChalkClient
from src.features import User

client =  ChalkClient()
client.query(
    input={User.id: "1"},
    output=[User.profile.id, User.profile.email_age_years]
)
```
