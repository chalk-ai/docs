In a one-to-one relationship, two feature sets have at most one
feature set on both sides of the relation.
One-to-one relationships are specified via the function
`has_one`, where the first argument specifies a function returning
how to join the tables.

##Recommended Implementation

Specified below is the simplest way to demonstrate a join.

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class Profile:
    ...
    user_id: str
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    ...
    uid: Profile.user_id
    profile: Profile
```

This specifies that `User.uid` is of type `str` and `User.profile` is a has-one feature
through the join `User.uid == Profile.user_id`.

The above is equivalent to the following, where the join is explicity specified.

In the example below, users have an associated profile:

```py
from chalk.features import features, has_one, ...

@features
class Profile:
    ...
    user_id: str
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    ...
    uid: str
    profile: Profile = has_one(lambda: Profile.user_id == User.uid)
```

<TipInfo>
  The `lambda` solves forward references, letting you reference `User` before it is defined.
</TipInfo>

You can also reference the join from the foreign feature class, if you prefer.
The following is equivalent to the two examples above.

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class Profile:
    ...
    user_id: "User.uid"
    email_age_years: float

@features
class User:
    ...
    uid: str
    profile: Profile
```

Now, you can reference features on `Profile` through `User`. For example:

```py
user_email_age = User.profile.email_age_years
```

## Back-references

### One-to-one

You can also add the back-reference to `User` from `Profile`.
You don't have to explicitly use `has_one` again on `Profile`, however.
Instead, the join condition is assumed to be symmetric and copied over.
Building on the above example, all you need to do
to complete the one-to-one relationship is to add a `User` to
the `Profile` class:

<PyDiffEditor html={oneToOneDiff} />

<TipInfo>Here you need to use quotes around `User` to use a forward reference.</TipInfo>

### Optional relationships

You can define optional relationships simply by
using the `typing.Optional[...]` keyword:

<PyDiffEditor html={hasOneOptionalDiff} />
