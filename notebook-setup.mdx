## Installation

### Dependencies

Install Chalk in your notebook environment by running the following command in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
!pip install chalkpy[all]
```

### Authentication

To use Chalk in a notebook, we will need to generate a client ID and secret key pair.

In the Chalk Dashboard, under **Settings > Access Tokens**,
generate a client ID and secret key pair by clicking on **New Token** and selecting all necessary permissions.

We will need the client ID and client secret we generated to initialize
a Chalk client in our notebook.

---

## Environment Setup

You can use the `ChalkClient` from any Jupyter notebook environment.

### Local

If you are working with a local notebook, Chalk will pick up your credentials
generated from running `chalkpy login` in your terminal.

All you need to do is initialize the client:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

### Deepnote

On Deepnote, you can set [environment variables](https://deepnote.com/docs/environment-variables) by going to the
integrations tab and clicking on the "Environment Variables" button.

Set the `CHALK_CLIENT_ID` and `CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET` variables to the values you generated in the previous step.
You can then initialize Chalk by running the following code in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
import os
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient(branch="new-feature")
```

### Hex

On [Hex](https://hex.tech), you can store the client ID and secret key using [secrets](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/environment-configuration/environment-views#secrets)

![Hex Secrets](/img/HexSecrets.png)

Select `Python 3.10` as the image under **Environment > Compute Profile**.

![Hex Python Image](/img/HexPythonImage.png)

The Chalk client can then be initialized referencing the variables directly

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient(branch="new-feature")
```

### Vertex & Google Colab Enterprise

On Google Colab Enterprise, you can set up secrets using the Google Secret Manager.
Add secrets named `chalk-client-id` and `chalk-client-secret` to Google Secret Manager
for your Chalk client id and client secret.

![Google Colab Secret](/img/ColabSecret.png)

Add three dependencies to your notebook environment: `google-cloud-secret-manager`,
`google-cloud-resource-manager`, and `chalkpy`.

You can now read your credentials securely from the Google Secret Manager and
initialize your Chalk client!

```python
# !pip install google-cloud-secret-manager
# !pip install google-cloud-resource-manager
# !pip install chalkpy
import os

from google.cloud import secretmanager as sm
from google.cloud import resourcemanager_v3 as rm

from chalk.client import ChalkClient

# Create the Secret Manager client.
PROJECT_NAME = os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT']

# These should match the names given to your secrets in Google Secret Manager
client_id_name = "chalk-client-id"
client_secret_name   = "chalk-client-secret"

# Get the project ID from google resources
project_id = rm.ProjectsClient().get_project(
    request=rm.GetProjectRequest(
      name=f"projects/{PROJECT_NAME}"
    )
).name

# Get CHALK_CLIENT_ID and CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET using the secret manager
secret_client = sm.SecretManagerServiceClient()

CHALK_CLIENT_ID = secret_client.access_secret_version(
    name=f"{project_id}/secrets/{client_id_name}/versions/1"
).payload.data.decode("utf-8")

CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET = secret_client.access_secret_version(
    name=f"{project_id}/secrets/{client_secret_name}/versions/1"
).payload.data.decode("utf-8")


# Instantiate your Chalk Client
chalk_client = ChalkClient(
    client_id=CHALK_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET,
    branch="new-feature"
)
```

## Creating a branch

To start using Chalk in a notebook, we will need to create a [branch deployment](/docs/branches).
Branch deployments are isolated environments that can be used to test features and resolvers before deploying them to production.

Working in a branch makes it seamless to iterate on features and resolvers in notebooks.
Any time we execute a cell in our notebook with feature or resolver definitions,
Chalk will automatically update our branch deployment with the latest changes.

Once you've got your client setup, you can create a branch calling [`create_branch`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.create_branch).
Setting `switch=True` will point your client to the newly created branch.

```python notebook.ipynb
client.create_branch("my-branch", switch=True)
```
