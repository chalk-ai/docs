In this section, we walk through authentication: how to connect to Chalk from a
notebook.

To authenticate, we recommend generating a client ID and secret key pair.

This can be done in the Chalk Dashboard. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens**,
and generate a client ID/secret key pair by clicking on **New Token** and selecting
all necessary permissionsâ€”(typically, online query, offline query, and preview
deployment permissions should be sufficient).

You can then use your access credentials to connect Chalk to any Jupyter notebook
environment. In the following section, we show the process of authenticating
to a [local notebook](#local). We then show the process for [Hex](#hex), [Deepnote](#deepnote), and [Vertex](#vertex-and-google-colab-enterprise).

## Local

If you are working with a local notebook, Chalk will pick up your credentials
generated from running `chalk login` in your terminal.

All you need to do is initialize the client:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

## Hex

On [Hex](https://hex.tech), you can store the client ID and secret key using [secrets](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/environment-configuration/environment-views#secrets)

Select `Python 3.10` as the image under **Environment > Compute Profile**.

The Chalk client can then be initialized referencing the variables directly.

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient(
  client_id=CHALK_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret=CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET,
  branch='notebook'
)
```

## Deepnote

On Deepnote, you can set [environment variables](https://deepnote.com/docs/environment-variables) by going to the
integrations tab and clicking on the "Environment Variables" button.

Set the `CHALK_CLIENT_ID` and `CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET` variables to the values you generated in the previous step.
You can then initialize Chalk by running the following code in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
import os
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

## Vertex & Google Colab Enterprise

On Google Colab Enterprise, you can set up secrets with the Google Secret Manager.
Add two secrets named `chalk-client-id` and `chalk-client-secret` to Google Secret Manager
that correspond to your Chalk client id and client secret.

![Google Colab Secret](/img/ColabSecret.png)

Add three dependencies to your notebook environment: `google-cloud-secret-manager`,
`google-cloud-resource-manager`, and `chalkpy`.

You can now read your credentials securely from the Google Secret Manager and
initialize your Chalk client!

```python
# !pip install google-cloud-secret-manager
# !pip install google-cloud-resource-manager
# !pip install chalkpy
import os

from google.cloud import secretmanager as sm
from google.cloud import resourcemanager_v3 as rm

from chalk.client import ChalkClient

# Create the Secret Manager client.
PROJECT_NAME = os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT']

# These should match the names given to your secrets in Google Secret Manager
client_id_name = "chalk-client-id"
client_secret_name  = "chalk-client-secret"

# Get the project ID from google resources
project_id = rm.ProjectsClient().get_project(
    request=rm.GetProjectRequest(
      name=f"projects/{PROJECT_NAME}"
    )
).name

# Get CHALK_CLIENT_ID and CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET using the secret manager
secret_client = sm.SecretManagerServiceClient()

CHALK_CLIENT_ID = secret_client.access_secret_version(
    name=f"{project_id}/secrets/{client_id_name}/versions/1"
).payload.data.decode("utf-8")

CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET = secret_client.access_secret_version(
    name=f"{project_id}/secrets/{client_secret_name}/versions/1"
).payload.data.decode("utf-8")


# Instantiate your Chalk Client
chalk_client = ChalkClient(
    client_id=CHALK_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET,
    branch="new-feature"
)
```
