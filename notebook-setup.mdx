## Installation

### Dependencies

```python notebook.ipynb
!pip install chalkpy[all]
```

### Generating access tokens

To use Chalk in a notebook, we will need to generate an access token.

To generate an access token, in the Chalk Dashboard, under the **Settings > Access Tokens**
Generate an access token by clicking on **New Token** and select all necessary permissions.

We will need the `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET_KEY` of the access token we generated to initialize
a Chalk client in our notebook.

---

## Environment Setup

You can use the `ChalkClient` from any Jupiter notebook environment.

### Local

If you are working with a local notebook, Chalk will pick up your access token
generated from running `chalkpy login` in your terminal.

All you need to do is initialize the client:

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

### Deepnote

On Deepnote, you can set [environment variables](https://deepnote.com/docs/environment-variables) by going to the
integrations tab and clicking on the "Environment Variables" button.

Set the `CHALK_CLIENT_ID` and `CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET` variables to the values you generated in the previous step.
You can then initialize Chalk by running the following code in a cell:

```python notebook.ipynb
import os
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

### Hex

On [Hex](https://hex.tech), you can store your access tokens using [secrets](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/environment-configuration/environment-views#secrets)

The Chalk client can then be initialized referencing the variables directly

```python notebook.ipynb
from chalk import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
```

## Creating a branch

To start using Chalk in a notebook, we will need to create a [branch deployment](/docs/branches).
Branch deployments are isolated environments that can be used to test features and resolvers before deploying them to production.

Working in a branch makes it seamless to iterate on features and resolvers in notebooks.
Any time we execute a cell in our notebook with feature or resolver definitions,
Chalk will automatically update our branch deployment with the latest changes.

Once you've got your client setup, you can create a branch calling [`create_branch`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.create_branch).
Setting `switch=True` will point your client to the newly created branch.

```python notebook.ipynb
client.create_branch("my-branch", switch=True)
```
