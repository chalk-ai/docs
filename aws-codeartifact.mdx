Chalk supports downloading Python packages from private AWS CodeArtifact repositories. In order to use this feature,
you must provide a Chalk IAM principal access to your repository so that Chalk can authenticate with the CodeArtifact
pip registry.

## Grant access to Chalk

Chalk will authenticate to your CodeArtifact repository using an IAM principal. You can view the IAM principal
in your team's settings page. The principal will look like this:

```
arn:aws:iam::***********:role/chalk-*********
```

Once you have the IAM principal ARN, you will need to grant the following permissions to the principal:

```
codeartifact:DescribePackageVersion
codeartifact:DescribeRepository
codeartifact:GetPackageVersionReadme
codeartifact:GetRepositoryEndpoint
codeartifact:ListPackages
codeartifact:ListPackageVersions
codeartifact:ListPackageVersionAssets
codeartifact:ListPackageVersionDependencies
codeartifact:ReadFromRepository
```

These permissions are derived from [AWS's instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/repo-policies.html).
These will grant Chalk the ability to read from the repository, but not to write to it. Here's an example IAM policy to do this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CodeArtifactPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "codeartifact:DescribePackageVersion",
        "codeartifact:DescribeRepository",
        "codeartifact:GetPackageVersionReadme",
        "codeartifact:GetRepositoryEndpoint",
        "codeartifact:ListPackages",
        "codeartifact:ListPackageVersions",
        "codeartifact:ListPackageVersionAssets",
        "codeartifact:ListPackageVersionDependencies",
        "codeartifact:ReadFromRepository"
      ],
      "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::***********:role/chalk-*********"
       },
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you have created this policy, you can attach it to your repository with the following example command:

```sh
aws codeartifact put-repository-permissions-policy --domain my_domain --domain-owner 111122223333 \
          --repository my_repo --policy-document file:///PATH/TO/policy.json
```


## Configure Chalk

Once you have completed the above steps, please reach out to your Chalk support representative with the following values:

- your CodeArtifact domain name
- your CodeArtifact account number ("domain owner")
- your repository name

Chalk will configure the deployment pipeline in your account to integrate this repository.
