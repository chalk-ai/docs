## Basic Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the Chalk Elixir client:

```elixir
# Configure the client
config :chalk_elixir,
  client_id: "your-client-id",
  client_secret: "your-client-secret",
  environment_id: "your-environment-id"

# Query features
defmodule MyApp do
  alias ChalkElixir.Client

  def query_features do
    {:ok, result} = Client.query(
      %{
        inputs: %{
          "user.id" => "user123"
        },
        outputs: [
          "user.credit_score",
          "user.account_age_days"
        ]
      }
    )

    IO.inspect(result)
  end
end
```
