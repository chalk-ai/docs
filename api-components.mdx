Chalk's feature pipeline helps you define the features you need and compute their values.
The following concepts are the foundation of our implementation:

- **[Features](/docs/features)** - Chalk lets you spell out your feature
  values using Python classes. Feature classes are [namespaced](/docs/features#namespacing), and can have
  [relationships](/docs/has-one) to other feature namespaces.
- **[Resolvers](/docs/resolver-overview)** - Resolvers compute the values
  of your features from other feature values. Feature resolvers are defined
  [online and offline](/docs/resolver-online-offline) for inference and training,
  and support [ETL between online and offline](/docs/reverse-etl).
- **[Online Inference](/docs/query-basics)** - In production, you can query
  your features through one of Chalk's API clients. At query time, you can choose
  to [override any feature caching](/docs/query-caching).
- **[Training](/docs/temporal-consistency)** - Chalk supports querying your
  offline features directly from a [Python notebook](/docs/query-offline).
- **[Data Export](/docs/sinks)** - Data can be exported from your offline
  feature store to any destination of your choice.
