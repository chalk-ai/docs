Chalk provides official support for GitHub actions.
You can install the Chalk CLI and create deployments
(preview and production) from pre-built GitHub actions

---

## Installing the Chalk CLI

You will need to create a Chalk token from the settings
page of your dashboard and store the resulting client
id and secret as
[GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

This step supports the following inputs:

- `client-id`: The Chalk Client ID from the tokens page in your settings.
- `client-secret`: The Chalk Client Secret from the tokens page in your settings.
- `version` (optional): The version of `chalk` to install, defaulting to `latest`.
- `api-host` (optional): If you're using a self-hosted deployment, the API host where Chalk is hosted.
- `environment` (optional): The Chalk environment to use. Your token is typically scoped to a single environment, and you won't need to use this parameter.

### Example

```yaml
- uses: chalk-ai/cli-action@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{secrets.CHALK_CLIENT_ID}}
    client-secret: ${{secrets.CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET}}
    # Optional: Version of the Chalk CLI to install. Defaults to `latest`
    version: latest
    # Optional: Environment to use. Optional for environment-scoped tokens.
    environment: dev
    # Optional: Used for Hybrid Cloud deployments
    api-host: https://custom.deployment.com/
```

For more information, see the [chalk-ai/cli-action](https://github.com/chalk-ai/cli-action) repository
or see a complete GitHub Action at [chalk-ai/examples](https://github.com/chalk-ai/examples).

## Deploying to Chalk

You can deploy to Chalk by first installing the CLI, as in the section above.
Or, you can use the [chalk-ai/deploy-action](https://github.com/chalk-ai/cli-action) step.
This step supports the following inputs:

- `client-id`: The Chalk Client ID from the tokens page in your settings.
- `client-secret`: The Chalk Client Secret from the tokens page in your settings.
- `await` (optional): Should this step block until it completes? Defaults to true.
- `no-promote` (optional): By default, Chalk will deploy to your production environment. With no-promote, your pipelines will deploy to a preview environment.
- `version` (optional): The version of `chalk` to install, defaulting to `latest`.
- `api-host` (optional): If you're using a self-hosted deployment, the API host where Chalk is hosted.
- `environment` (optional): The Chalk environment to use. Your token is typically scoped to a single environment, and you won't need to use this parameter.

### Example

```yaml
- uses: chalk-ai/deploy-action@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{secrets.CHALK_CLIENT_ID}}
    client-secret: ${{secrets.CHALK_CLIENT_SECRET}}
    # Optional: Version of the Chalk CLI to install. Defaults to `latest`
    version: latest
    # Optional: Environment to use. Optional for environment-scoped tokens.
    environment: dev
    # Optional: Used for Hybrid Cloud deployments
    api-host: https://custom.deployment.com/
```
