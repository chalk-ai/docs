Chalk is testing a direct SQL query interface for your feature values.
Feature classes function like SQL tables in this model,
and [has-one relationships](/docs/has-one) and [has-many relationships](/docs/has-many)
can be used as joins to other feature tables.

Chalk's interface supports read-only ANSI-SQL queries to your offline feature store.
For example, if you have the feature classes:

```py
@features
class User:
    uid: str
    full_name: str

@features
class Transfer:
    uid: str
    amount_cents: str
    user: User
```

You can join across feature classes and select data from them:

```sql
SELECT transfer.amount_cents, user.full_name
FROM transfer
JOIN user
ON user.uid = transfer.uid
```

This allows you to use computed features directly in BI dashboards and for analytics use-cases.
