## Overview

The `Settings` page of the dashboard exposes many useful configurations that you can use to
tune your Chalk environments to scale to handle your specific workload and latency requirements.

### Cloud Resource Configuration

Under `Settings > Resources`, you will find the Cloud Resource Configuration page. In this page, you
can specify how you would like to scale the different resource groups in your Chalk environment, and
even create new resource groups.

Under each resource group, for each service, you can specify the targets for resource requests,
resource limits, scaling, and parallelism. For most use cases, adjusting the `Requests` and `Scaling`
targets will help you optimize your environment for your workload. The `Requests` will specify
the resources to be allocated to an instance of your service, and the `Scaling` will define upper
and lower bounds for the number of instances of your service. In terms of scaling, there are two
ways to auto-scale your services:

1. **CPU-based Scaling**: If you set `Target CPU %` in the Cloud Resource Configuration, then Chalk will
   scale the service based on the CPU utilization of the service. If the CPU utilization is above the
   target, Chalk will scale up the service, and if it is below the target, Chalk will scale down the service.
2. **Scheduled Scaling**: You can specify scaling resources up or down on a schedule by modifying the
    spec config in the `JSON` tab of the `Cloud Resource Configuration` page. In order to do scheduled
    scaling, you must have KEDA configured in your environment. Please reach out to the Chalk team if
    you are interested in scheduled scaling.

In addition to specifying resource targets, you can also navigate to the `Advanced` configurations for
even more fine-grained control over your resources.

The Kubernetes Node Selector enables you to specify the machine family you would like to use for your
deployment. For example, this would map to [EC2 Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)
for AWS deployments or [Compute Engine Machine Families](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource)
for GCP deployments.

The `Auto Shutdown Period` dropdown enables you to select the amount of time of inactivity after which you'd like the
branch server to spin down.

In addition, you can set Environment dyVariable Overrides. If you have any questions about how to best configure
your environment for your use case, reach out to the Chalk team.

### Kubernetes

Under `Settings > Kubernetes`, you can view all of the pods in your Kubernetes cluster under the namespace
for your environment, in addition to their phase and creation timestamp. This can be very useful for
debugging and monitoring the health of your environment.

### Connections

Under `Settings > Connections`, you can view all of the connections that your environment has to external
resources, such as your online and offline stores, and the branch server.

### User Permissions

Under `Settings > User Permissions`, you can view the roles associated with each user, as well as whether those
roles are granted directly or via SCIM.
