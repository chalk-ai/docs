Chalk provides specialized prompts to help Large Language Models (LLMs) write effective Chalk code.
These prompts are designed to guide AI assistants in understanding Chalk's patterns, best practices,
and API conventions.

---

## Getting Started

1. Run the [chalk init agent-prompt](/cli/init_agent-prompt) command to add the prompt to your local repository.
2. Provide specific context about your feature requirements
3. Review generated code for adherence to your team's conventions
4. Test the generated features in your development environment

By using these specialized prompts, you can leverage AI assistance to write more consistent
and idiomatic Chalk code while reducing development time and improving code quality.

## Agent Prompts Repository

The Chalk team maintains the public repository [chalk-ai/agent-prompts](https://github.com/chalk-ai/agent-prompts)
with prompts specifically designed for LLM-assisted Chalk development:

This repository contains prompts that are tested against LLM providers to help them understand:

- Chalk's feature definition patterns
- Built-in LLM integration capabilities
- Resolver implementation best practices
- Data source integration patterns
- Template interpolation syntax
- Model selection and configuration
