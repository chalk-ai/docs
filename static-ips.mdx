## Overview

Chalk infrastructure operates from a set of static IP addresses and CIDR blocks. If you need to configure firewall rules, IP allowlists, or security policies (such as in Okta or other corporate security tools), you can use this page as a reference for all Chalk infrastructure IP addresses.

This list is organized by category to help you identify which addresses you need to allow based on your security requirements.

## Tailscale Routing

Chalk uses Tailscale for network connectivity in some environments. In order to use Tailscale routing, the Tailscale control plane may need to be whitelisted. Please see the vendor documentation for details. This entry is optional, but recommended at this time.

| Chalk Label | CIDR Block |
|---|---|---|
| cidr-block-1 | 192.200.0.0/24 |

For additional information about Tailscale firewall ports and configuration, see the [Tailscale firewall documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1082/firewall-ports).

## Subject to Change

These addresses are current as of publishing and are composed of static IP addresses and long-lived address assignments. Please note that whitelist entries may change in the future as the platform evolves. Chalk will update this page and communicate updates when needed.
