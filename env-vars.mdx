Chalk lets you inject environment variables into the
runtime for your resolvers.
You can add an environment variable through the dashboard,
where you'll find a form that looks like this:

<AddNewEnvVar onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

Here, you can provide any environment variable you need.
The value will be available in all the environments you
check on the right side of the pane.

Environment variables can include secrets or configuration.
All environment variables are securely stored using a
[Key Management Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management).

Then, in your [resolver](/docs/resolver-overview)
or in a [setup hook](/docs/generic),
you can access these environment variables as you would
normally:

```py
import os

value = os.getenv("my_variable")
```

## Chalk environment variables

Chalk also provides a few environment variables that you
can use in your resolvers.
