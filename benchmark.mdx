After setting up your features, resolvers, etc., you'll want to see if your queries meet your speed requirements! We have a tool in alpha to make this process easier. To explore the most up-to-date options available, run `chalk benchmark --help` in the terminal using the CLI tool.

## Scale

It's important to isolate and scale your resources with the level of benchmark you are performing. The larger the QPS, the larger and/or more machines you'll need. With more cached features, you may need to increase your online store's capabilities as well. In the case of Valkey/Redis, this could be increasing your cluster size and/or node capacity. You can read more about how to update these resources on our [Resource Configuration Page](/docs/resource-configuration)
