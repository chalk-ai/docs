Chalk supports [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as a [SQL source](/docs/sql).

## Adding DynamoDB
Follow the [AWS instructions](/docs/aws) to give Chalk access to application credentials for your AWS account. Chalk
will use these credentials to access DynamoDB.

## Integration

Add your DynamoDB data source in a Python file and give it a `name`. In this file, we'll also define a `User` feature
class with a `transaction_volume` feature which will be resolved with DynamoDB.

```python
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import DynamoDBSource

DynamoDBSource(name="my_dynamo")

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float
```

Now, you are all set to use DynamoDB with [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers):

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: user
-- source: my_dynamo
SELECT
    id,
    TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume
FROM
    UserTable
```

This file resolves the `User.transaction_volume` feature. Please note that the `--source: my_dynamo` line is necessary
and should match the `name` provided to your `DynamoDBSource`.

Chalk uses [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/) to execute SQL queries on your DynamoDB connection. Chalk extends PartiQL to
support alias syntax so that you can rename your result columns to match your feature names. The above example
demonstrates aliasing with `TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume`.

You can use [batch execution with
PartiQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.multiplestatements.batching.html)
to retrieve multiple records in a single request via [`ChalkClient.query_bulk`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.query_bulk). Batch
execution is only supported for single table queries.
