Chalk supports [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as a natively accelerated [SQL source](/docs/sql). After connecting your AWS
credentials, you will be able to query your DynamoDB instance through Chalk with [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/).

---

## Adding DynamoDB

Follow the [AWS instructions](/docs/aws) to give Chalk access to application credentials for your AWS account. Chalk
will use these credentials to access DynamoDB.

---

## Integration

Add your DynamoDB data source in a Python file and give it a `name`. This line is required for all DynamoDB
integrations. In this file, we'll also define a `User` feature class with a `transaction_volume` feature which will be
resolved with DynamoDB.

```python
from chalk.features import features
from chalk.sql import DynamoDBSource

DynamoDBSource(name="user_data")  # required for Chalk to be aware of this source

@features
class User:
    id: str
    transaction_volume: float
    high_volume: bool = _.transaction_volume > 1000
```

Now, you are all set to use DynamoDB with [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql#sql-file-resolvers):

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: user_data
SELECT
    id,
    TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume
FROM UserTable
```

This file resolves two features of the feature class `User`: `User.transaction_volume` and `User.id`.
When the `User.transaction_volume` feature is required (or if it's needed for computing a downstream feature
like `User.high_volume`), Chalk will execute the SQL query on your DynamoDB instance and
return the result.
The `-- source: user_data` comment tells Chalk to use the `DynamoDBSource` with the name `user_data` to resolve this
query.

## Chalk's DynamoDB Query Language

Chalk uses [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/) to execute SQL queries on your DynamoDB connection. Chalk extends PartiQL to
support aliasing and limits: you can rename your result columns to match your feature names
and limit results. The above example demonstrates aliasing with `TransactionVolume AS transaction_volume`.

Chalk extends PartiQL with the following syntax:

```
--- Amazon PartiQL
SELECT expression  [, ...]
FROM table[.index]
[ WHERE condition ] [ ORDER BY key [DESC|ASC] , ...]

--- Chalk PartiQL
SELECT expression [AS alias] [, ...]
FROM table[.index]
[ WHERE condition ] [ ORDER BY key [DESC|ASC] , ...]
[ LIMIT limit ]
```

You can also use [batch execution with
PartiQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.multiplestatements.batching.html)
to retrieve multiple records in a single request via [`ChalkClient.query_bulk`](/api-docs#ChalkClient.query_bulk). Batch
execution is only supported for single table queries.
