Chalk is the fastest way to deploy new features and feature
pipelines to production.
This demo covers creating a new feature.
You'll develop, unit test, integration test,
and deploy a resolver for this feature.
Then you'll see how to backfill that feature
to Chalk's offline store so that data scientists
can use it in historical training sets.

## Develop

The first step is to write a new feature and resolver for that feature.
Imagine you wanted to create a new feature called `user.name_email_match_score`.
This feature should capture the similarity between a user's name and email.
Put another way:
`andy` and `andy@gmail.com` should produce a high score, and
`emily` and `andy@gmail.com` should produce a low score.

The first step is to add the new feature, and a resolver for that feature.

<PyDiffEditor html={createResolverCode} filename={'example.py'} />

Our new resolver `name_email_match_scorer` takes a dependency on
the user's email and fullname in the argument list.
Then, it declares that it returns the `User.name_email_match_score`
in the return type signature.

In the body of the function, we compute the
[Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
between the email without the domain and the full name.

---

## Test

Now that you've written the new feature and resolver, it's time
to validate your change.
Chalk supports both unit testing and integration testing of your
feature pipelines.

### Unit test

You can [unit test](/docs/unit-tests) resolvers just like normal
Python functions using any unit testing framework:

```py
from pytest import approx

def test_name_email_match_scorer():
    assert approx(0.60) == name_email_match_scorer(
        "katherine.johnson@nasa.gov",
        "Katherine Johnson",
    )
    assert approx(0.39) == name_email_match_scorer(
        "katherine.johnson@nasa.gov",
        "Eleanor Roosevelt",
    )
```

Here, the
[Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
for `katherine.johnson@nasa.gov` is higher with the name
`Katherine Johnson` than with the name `Eleanor Roosevelt`,
as expected.

### Deploy branch

Now that the unit tests have passed,
you can create a [Branch Deploy](/docs/integration-tests#branch-deployments)
with the new changes.

Chalk allows you to create an unlimited number of branch deployments.
Branch deployments run all of your resolvers in the same way
that they run in production. However, branch deployments don't impact
the [offline store](/docs/query-offline). You can create a branch
deployment with the following command:

```bash
chalk apply --branch test
```

### Integration test

With the [branch deployment](/docs/integration-tests#branch-deployments) created, you can run integration tests
on your changes.

<PyEditor html={integrationTest} filename={'integration_test.py'} />

Here, the
[Chalk API client](/docs/query-basics)
is configured to use the preview deployment id returned
in the previous step.

---

## Deploy

Once you've tested your changes, it's time to deploy!
This step looks much like the preview deployment,
but this time without the [`--branch`](/cli/apply#branch) flag:

```bash
chalk apply
```

Now, your production environments can request the new
`user.name_email_match_score` feature.

```bash
chalk query --in user.id=1 --out user.name_email_match_score
```

---

## Backfill

The `user.name_email_match_score` feature is live!
But historically, this feature did not exist,
and you won't be able to sample its values at previous times
until you backfill the values, which you can do with the ['chalk trigger'](cli/trigger) command.

```bash
chalk trigger --resolver example.name_email_match_scorer --lower-bound 2020-05-05T12:00:00+00:00 --persist-offline=True
```

This command will backfill historical values for the `user.name_email_match_score` feature.

### Offline training

With the feature backfilled, you can query
the historical value:

<JupyterNotebook contents={'/examples/jupyter-demo-2'} />

That's how you deploy a new feature with Chalk!

## Delete

Mistakes are inevitable, but Chalk provides the tools you need to quickly and easily recover and keep going.

### Drop a feature

If you need to change a feature's type (for example from `string` to `int`), or if you want to drop all the data for a feature value, the [Chalk CLI](/cli/) has you covered with [`chalk drop`](/cli/drop).  Simply execute the command from the CLI and you'll have a fresh start to recreate the feature and its data as necessary.

### Delete a row

Sometimes you just need to fully remove a record from your systems, whether because of a GDPR mandated "right to forget" request or due to a business requirement.  Chalk provides the [`chalk delete`](/cli/delete) command to meet this need.
