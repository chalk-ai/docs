Resolvers declare the features that they resolve
through a
[Python type annotation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#functions)
on the return value of the function.

## Scalar output

### Single output

To return a single feature from a resolver,
set the return type annotation to the feature you
want to resolve:

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    employer: str

@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> User.name:
    return "Jennifer Doudna"
```

Equivalently, you can wrap the return value in the `User` class:

```diff-py
@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> User.name:
-   return "Jennifer Doudna"
+   return User(name="Jennifer Doudna")
```

### Multiple outputs

To return multiple features, return an
[instance of the feature class](/docs/features#constructing-feature-classes).
In the type signature, specify
the `Features[...]` class, parameterized
by the features that you pass to the feature class.

```diff-py
@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> Features[User.name, User.employer]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

You only need to pass
[a subset of the features](/docs/features#constructing-feature-classes)
to the constructor for the feature class.

The [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup) will check
that the type annotation you assign to the resolver
matches subset of features passed to the constructor
of the feature set.

### All features

To return all features of a class,
use `Features[...]` around the feature class.

```py
@online
def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

If your resolver takes input features, those features are not
considered as part of the output features.

Note that the `id` feature is not returned from the function.

This definition is equivalent to:

```diff-py
@online
- def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User]:
+ def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User.name, User.employer]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

However, you may want to return _almost_ all features of a class.
Writing out all the features can be tedious and error-prone.
You can subtract features from a feature class
using the `-` operator:

```py
from chalk.features import Features, ...

@online
def get_all_users(id: User.id) -> Features[User] - User.name:
    return User(employer="University of California, Berkeley")
```

Here, both the `id` feature and the `name` feature are not returned,
which leaves only the `employer` feature.

## DataFrame output

You can also output many instances of a feature set from a resolver
by specifying a [DataFrame](/docs/dataframe) as the return type of
the function:

```py
@offline
def get_events() -> DataFrame[Transfer.uuid, Transfer.amount, Transfer.ts]:
    return DataFrame.read_csv(...)
```

For more info on how to load batch data,
see the [Data Sources](/docs/sql) sections.
`DataFrame`-returning resolvers don't need inputs.


### All features

To return all features of a class in a DataFrame,
use `DataFrame[...]` class around the feature class:

```py
@online
def get_all_users() -> DataFrame[User]:
    return DataFrame([
        User(
            name="Jennifer Doudna",
            employer="University of California, Berkeley"
        )
    ])
```

### Other DataFrame-returning resolvers

Imagine a scalar feature you'd like to backfill over many thousands of pkeys and historical times.
`DataFrame`-returning resolvers can dramatically reduce the computation time due to its vectorized handling.

```py
@offline
def get_new_feature_as_dataframe(
    df: DataFrame[Transaction.id, ...]
) -> DataFrame[Transaction.id, Transaction.new_feature]:
```

The above resolver runs faster on a thousand rows
than the equivalent scalar resolver ran a thousand times.

Chalk also supports relationship-returning resolvers that enable users to
return a `DataFrame` belonging to a has-many relationship.

```py
@offline
def relationship_returning_resolver(
    df: User.transactions[Transaction.id, Transaction.amount, Transaction.description],
    user_type: User.type
) -> User.transactions[Transaction.id, Transaction.transaction_type]:
```

Just make sure that the return `DataFrame`s do not have duplicate rows.
That means no two rows should have the same primary key, or primary key & timestamp combinations if the
feature time is also returned.
