Create a data aggregation over a time range using a Windowed Feature.
For example, use windowed features to count the number of login attempts made by a user over the past 10 minutes, or
to track the largest purchase amount a cardholder has made in the past 30 days.

For performant aggregations over large volumes of data, such as calculating real-time aggregations over user transactions,
Chalk has first-class support for [materialized windowed aggregations](/docs/materialized_aggregations).

## Set up a data aggregation using windowed features

Here is an example of a [`windowed`](/api-docs/#windowed) feature representing the number of
failed logins in the last 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 day:

```py
from chalk import Windowed, windowed
from chalk.features import DataFrame, _
from datetime import datetime

@features
class LoginAttempt:
    id: int
    user: "User.id"
    status: str
    at: datetime

@features
class User:
    id: int
    login_attempts: DataFrame[LoginAttempt]
    num_failed_logins: Windowed[int] = windowed(
        "10m", "30m", "1d",
        max_staleness="10m",
        expression=_.login_attempts[
            _.status=="failed",
            _.at > _.chalk_window
        ].count(),
        default=0,
    )
```

Windowed features support much of the same functionality as normal features. They are most often used alongside
[`max_staleness`](/api-docs#windowed.max_staleness) and
[`etl_offline_to_online`](/api-docs#windowed.etl_offline_to_online).

Windowed features are typically resolved, either:
- inline by [expressions](/docs/expression),
- by [stream resolvers](/docs/streams), or
- by materialized aggregates.

### Querying by windowed time range

Windowed features resolved via [expressions](/docs/expression) can reference the current windowed time range
using the `_.chalk_window` operator:

```python
from chalk import Windowed, windowed
from chalk.features import DataFrame, _
from datetime import datetime

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    amount: float
    at: datetime

@features
class User:
    id: int
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    total_spend: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d", "60d", "90d",
        default=0,
        expression=_.transactions[
            _.amount,
            _.at > _.chalk_window,
            _.at < _.chalk_now
        ].sum(),
        materialization={"bucket_duration": "1d"},
    )
```

In this code, the windowed feature will return the sum of transaction amounts for the given user over the last 30, 60,
and 90 days. `_.ts > _.chalk_window` is a boolean condition checking that the current transaction's timestamp is greater
than the start of the current window duration.

### Nested windowed feature references

Windowed features can also be referenced by other windowed features in the same feature class using
[expressions](/docs/expression) and the `_.chalk_window` operator. For example, we can compute the average
transaction amount over different time windows:

```python
@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    amount: float
    at: datetime

@features
class User:
    id: int
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    sum_transactions: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d", "60d", "90d",
        expression=_.transactions[
            _.amount,
            _.at > _.chalk_window,
            _.at < _.chalk_now
        ].sum(),
    )
    count_transactions: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d", "60d", "90d",
        expression=_.transactions[
            _.at > _.chalk_window,
            _.at < _.chalk_now
        ].count(),
    )
    avg_transaction_amount: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d", "60d", "90d",
        expression=(
            _.sum_transactions[_.chalk_window] /
            _.count_transactions[_.chalk_window]
        )
    )
```

### Referencing windowed features

A windowed feature can be referenced in a query or a resolver in the following, equivalent ways. Each
column below shows the possible syntax variants for a given time window.

```py
# Note: The last value for each list is the time converted to seconds
User.num_failed_logins("**10m**")    User.num_failed_logins("**1d**")       User.num_failed_logins("**1h30m**")
User.num_failed_logins["**10m**"]    User.num_failed_logins["**1d**"]       User.num_failed_logins["**1h30m**"]
User.num_failed_logins_10m       User.num_failed_logins_1d          User.num_failed_logins_1h30m
User.num_failed_logins__10m__    User.num_failed_logins__1d__       User.num_failed_logins__1h30m__
User.num_failed_logins__600__    User.num_failed_logins__86400__    User.num_failed_logins__5400__
```

Windowed features can be inputs to resolvers:

```python
@online
def account_under_attack(
    failed_logins_30m: User.num_failed_logins('30m'),
    failed_logins_1d: User.num_failed_logins('1d')
) -> ...:
    return failed_logins_30m > 10 or failed_logins_1d > 100
```
