Chalk supports [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) as a [SQL Source](/docs/sql).
You can configure the Databricks-specific options using the `DatabricksSource.__init__` args.
Alternately, you can configure the source through your dashboard.

## Integrations Setup

After configuring your Databricks integration in the dashboard, define your data sources in Python:

```py
from chalk.sql import DatabricksSource

risk = DatabricksSource(name="RISK")
marketing = DatabricksSource(name="MARKETING")
```

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `RISK` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: RISK
SELECT id, credit_score FROM users
```

And to query from the `MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: MARKETING
SELECT id, email, campaign_status FROM users
```

<span>{getEnvironmentVariableText("RISK", "DATABRICKS_HOST")}</span>
