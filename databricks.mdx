Chalk supports [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) as a [SQL Source](/docs/sql).
You can configure the Databricks-specific options using the `DatabricksSource.__init__` args.
Alternately, you can configure the source through your dashboard.

---

## Single Integration

If you have only one Databricks connection that you'd like
to add to Chalk, you do not need to specify any arguments
to construct the source in your code.

```py
from chalk.sql import DatabricksSource

databricks = DatabricksSource()
```

You can then use [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) to query your database:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: databricks
SELECT id, name, email FROM users
```

## Multiple Integrations

<span>{getNamedIntegrationText()}</span>

```py
from chalk.sql import DatabricksSource

risk = DatabricksSource(name="**RISK**")
marketing = DatabricksSource(name="**MARKETING**")
```

Then reference them in [SQL file resolvers](/docs/sql-resolvers) using the `name` parameter. For example, to query from the `RISK` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: RISK
SELECT id, credit_score FROM users
```

And to query from the `MARKETING` source:

```sql
-- type: online
-- resolves: User
-- source: MARKETING
SELECT id, email, campaign_status FROM users
```

<span>{getEnvironmentVariableText("RISK", "DATABRICKS_HOST")}</span>
