Chalk supports integration with [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com) for alerting.

## Creating an integration key

To connect PagerDuty to Chalk, you'll need to generate an integration key from
your PagerDuty settings page.

To install, go to the [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com) service you want to add Chalk
to, and click on the tab for integrations.
Click `Add another integration`, and then choose the `Events API V1` option.
Copy the `Integration Key` into your dashboard settings page.

For more information, see
[PagerDuty's guide](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#generate-a-new-integration-key)
to creating an integration key.

## Adding to Chalk

Once you have an integration key, you can insert it on your environment settings page.

Integrations are per-environment, so you'll want one PagerDuty integration key per
Chalk environment for which you'd like to configure alerting.
