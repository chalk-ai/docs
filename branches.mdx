title: Working With Branches
description: Make rapid changes and explore features with branches.

Branch deployments allow users to quickly iterate on features and datasets.  
When working in a branch users have a number of useful capabilities, including:

- Chalk can automatically watch your files and deploy any changes
- Updates to your project are deployed in seconds
- Adjust and create features and resolvers inside a JupyterNotebook
- Quickly `recompute` datasets to see the effects of changes
- Branches have a consistent name across deployments

---

## Create a Branch Deployment

To create a branch, simply run [`chalk apply --branch <branch_name>`](/cli/chalk#branch). Chalk will create a new branch in the environment that you can interact with. Now, you can make queries against your branch with `chalk query --branch`.  
If you're using the Python API, you can set the branch when creating your [client](/api-docs#ChalkClient), and all subsequent commands will execute against your branch.

### Continuously Deploy Changes

You can ask the Chalk CLI to continuously deploy changes to your branch using the [`watch`](cli/apply#watch) flag.  
Chalk will automatically keep the branch up to date as you make changes locally.

---

## Develop in a Notebook

One of the major advantages of branch deployments is the flexibility they offer when working in notebooks.  
Once you've deployed a branch, you can iteratively edit features and resolvers and see the effects of these updates in a dataset.
Create a chalk client and set the `branch` parameter equal to your branch. Then, any time you execute a cell that contains a class annotated with `@features` it will automatically be updated in your branch.
Similarly, executing cells that contain a function annotated with `@online` or `@offline` will automatically deploy the resolver to your branch.

```python
@features
class NewFeatures:
    id: int
    name: str
    greeting: str

@online
def new_resolver(name: NewFeatures.name) -> NewFeatures.greeting:
    return f"Hello {name}!"
```

---

## Recompute Datasets

As you adjust features and resolvers, you can iteratively see how your changes affect the your feature values with the [`Dataset.recompute`](/api-docs#Dataset.recompute) method. Just pass any features you want to be re-computed as arguments to the `features` parameter, and Chalk will generate a new Dataset revision using the latest definitions of features and resolvers.

When used in conjunction with the ability to adjust your features and resolvers in the notebook, this tool allows developers and data scientists to rapidly experiement and productionize their work.

## Example

In the following example we add an `oversize` feature to an existing dataset of loans.

We start out with a dataset. We may have produced this dataset manually, by calling an external API, or by executing offline_query.

```python
dataset
shape: (786, 3)
┌───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ loan.amount   ┆ loan.id      ┆ loan.event_time         │
│ ---           ┆ ---          ┆ ---                     │
│ f64           ┆ str          ┆ datetime[μs, UTC]       │

```

In our jupyter notebook, we can execute this in a cell to setup our notebook to point to our branch, then update our branch with the new feature and resolver.

```python
client = ChalkClient(branch="<our_branch>")

# We want to introduce an `oversize` detection feature
@features
class Loan:
    id: str
    event_time: datetime
    status: str
    amount: float
    oversize: bool

# Detect any loans bigger than $250,000
@online
def is_oversize(amt: Loan.amount) -> Loan.oversize:
    return amt > 250000
```

Finally, we can `recompute` our dataset, telling it to calculate `Loan.oversize`, to get a dataset back with our new feature values.

```python
# Recomputing the dataset will add the oversize column to our result
dataset.recompute(features=[Loan.oversize])
shape: (786, 4)
┌───────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
