After you've created some features and resolvers,
you can use them to generate values for training.

Chalk tracks all the values of the features you
compute, and times at which those values were
computed.

First, we need to sample some user ids on which to
build a dataset.

```python datascience/notebook.ipynb
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
from chalk.client import ChalkClient
from src.models import User

client = ChalkClient()

now = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)
ds = client.offline_query(
    output=[User.id],
    lower_bound=now - timedelta(hours=12),
    upper_bound=now,
)

```

```python datascience/notebook.ipynb
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

client = ChalkClient()
dataset = client.offline_query(
    input={
        User.id: [],
    },
    output=[],
    recompute_features=True,
)


ds = client.offline_query(
    input={
    "fraud_model.id": spine["fraud_model.id"].to_list()
    },
    input_times=spine['__chalk__.CHALK_TS'].to_list(),
    output=[
        "fraud_model.id",
        "fraud_model.card_created_at",
    ],
    recompute_features=True
)
```
