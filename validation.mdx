## Feature Values

Chalk can enforce requirements on your feature values.
You can validate the values and length of many primitive types
through the keyword arguments `min`, `max`, `min_length`, and `max_length`.

[//]: # (A feature which does not meet the given constraints will not be fed to downstream resolvers or returned in queries.)
To prevent 'invalid' features from being written
to the offline or online store, set `strict=True`.
In this case an error will be thrown when an invalid
feature is observed.
The `validations` keyword argument can be used when there are
multiple validations, only some of which are strict.

```python
from chalk import Validation
from chalk.features import feature, features

@features
class Office:
    size_sqft: int = feature(min=0, max=100_000_000)
    street: str = feature(validations=[
        Validation(min_length=1, max_length=256, strict=True),
        Validation(min_length=20, max_length=100)
    ])
```

## Feature validation requirements

For some features, it is important to specify metadata
such as `owner` and `description`.
Chalk allows you to enforce metadata requirement easily.
In addition, you can specify for each feature the severity
at which to raise a missing metadata issue.

In `chalk.yml`, the `validation > feature > metadata`
section specifies settings for metadata validation.
In the following example, users will be blocked from
deploying features ([`chalk apply`](/cli/apply)) with
an unspecified `owner`. They are allowed to deploy
features with missing `description` and `tags`.

```yaml
project: Predict Q2 Spending

validation:
  feature:
    metadata:
      - name: owner
        missing: error
      - name: description
        missing: warning
      - name: tags
        missing: info

environments:
  default:
    runtimes: 'python310'
    requirements: requirements.txt
```
