Chalk's feature platform enables
machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models
that make their business stand out. Chalk provides a feature store so that
you can deploy production machine learning pipelines for real time data
in minutes.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy their feature and data pipeline definitions
to Chalk’s platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs &
administers its platform on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed
infrastructure then executes the customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

To configure an Iceberg offline store, we need to configure the AWS Glue Catalog. This catalog ensures atomic operations on the underlying S3 storage. 

To get this setup, please share: 
- **S3 bucket** URI where you would like the offline store to be located.  The bucket name is typically `chalk-{organization}-data-bucket` (confirm with Chalk if different)
- **AWS Account ID**: The AWS account where your Chalk environment is deployed

You’ll also need to provide appropriate AWS permissions:
- **AWS**: Permissions to perform glue operations.
