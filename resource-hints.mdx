title: GPUs and Resource Hints
description: Schedule workloads on differentiated hardware & execution pools

Different workloads have different requirements. Some workloads are compute-intensive, while others are memory-intensive.
Some workloads require GPUs, some perform blocking IO, and some are purely CPU-bound.and

Chalk allows you to specify the hardware and execution pool requirements for your queries,
so that they can be scheduled on the most appropriate resources.

## Executing on Hardware with GPUs

Chalk allows you to execute specific resolvers on hardware with GPUs. To do this, you can use the `"gpu"` resource
hint in your resolver definition. This will ensure that the resolver is scheduled on a machine with a GPU.

```python
import torch
from chalk.features import online

@online(resource_hint="gpu")
def my_gpu_resolver(Transaction.memo) -> Transaction.cleaned_memo:
    """
    Run a torch model to process data using a GPU.
    """
    ...
```

Then, specify the [Resource Group](/docs/kube-resources-drilldown) that has the GPU resources available:

```
CHALK_GPU_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=gpu-resolvers
```

This resource group should:

- have a UDF Invoker Service deployed
- this service should have a node selector that matches nodes with GPUs, e.g.:

```yaml
cloud.google.com/machine-family: a2-highgpu
```

Chalk's query planner will execute the primary query plan on your Query Server service, and will transmit
row data to the GPU resolver service for processing in compressed Arrow format. Response data will be
transmitted back to the Query Server service, which will then return the final result to the client.

## CPU vs IO Pools

Chalk allows you to specify whether a resolver is CPU-bound or IO-bound. This is useful for scheduling
resolvers on the most appropriate resources. To do this, you can use the `"cpu"` or `"io"` resource hints in your resolver definition.

```python
from chalk.features import online

@online(resource_hint="cpu")
def my_cpu_bound_resolver(Transaction.memo) -> Transaction.cleaned_memo:
    """
    Run a CPU-bound operation.
    """
    fibbonaci = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 100):
        fibbonaci.append(fibbonaci[i - 1] + fibbonaci[i - 2])
    return fibbonaci

@online(resource_hint="io")
def my_io_bound_resolver(Transaction.memo) -> Transaction.cleaned_memo:
    """
    Run an IO-bound operation.
    """
    return requests.get("https://example.com/api/data").json()
```

Chalk uses CPU-count thread pools for CPU-bound resolvers, because additional threads do not help with CPU-bound workloads.
Chalk uses variable sized thread pools for IO-bound resolvers, because additional threads can help with IO-bound workloads.

Note: if you use async resolvers, Chalk will execute them on an asyncio event loop that is shared across all resolvers.
This means that you should not use blocking IO operations in async resolvers, as they will block the event loop and
prevent other resolvers from executing.
