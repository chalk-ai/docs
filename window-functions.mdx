Window functions are helpful for creating features that describe
recent behavior.
With window functions, you can implement features such as moving
averages or counts of events in a window.

Window functions are computed on a [DataFrame](/docs/dataframe).
A [has-many](/docs/has-many) feature creates a [DataFrame](/docs/dataframe)
on a feature set, which you can filter with the special functions
`before` and `after`.
These functions filter your data relative to the
current time in context. This time could be in the past
if you're using an offline resolver.
Using window functions ensures that you maintain
[point-in-time correctness](/docs/temporal-consistency).

Chalk supplies two functions, `before` and `after`,
which take many keyword arguments describing the time
relative to the present:

```py
# Keep where over three years and two days old
before(years_ago=3, days_ago=2)

# Keep where under 5:10 minutes old
after(minutes_ago=5, seconds_ago=10)
```

You can use these operators to filter out rows of a `DataFrame`:

## Before

To compute the number of transfers a user made in the
last seven days, you can use the `after(...)` function:

```py
from chalk.features import after, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[after(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```

## After

Alternatively, if you wanted to compute the number of transfers
a user made more than seven days ago, you would write:

```py
from chalk.features import after, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[before(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```

## Combining before and after

You can also combine `before` and `after`.
In this example, we return the transfers made over a week ago,
but less than two weeks ago.

```py
from chalk.features import before, after, ...

@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[after(days_ago=14), before(days_ago=7)]) -> ...:
    return transfers.count()
```
