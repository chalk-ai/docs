Python resolvers are Python functions marked with either an `@online` or `@offline` decorator,
with [Python type annotations](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#functions)
declaring the dependencies on other features, as well as the output feature(s).

---

## Inputs

### Scalar dependencies

To depend on features from a [feature class](/docs/features),
label your resolver arguments with your features as the types.
You can then use those arguments in the body of your resolver to
compute your [output features](/docs/python-resolvers#outputs).
If you're running our [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup),
your editor will see the type of each variable as the type
of the underlying scalar.

```py
from chalk.features import features, online

@features
class User:
    id: str
    email: str
    email_domain: str

@online
def get_domain(email: User.email) -> User.email_domain:
    # type(email) == str
    return email.split('@')[1].lower()
```

You can require multiple features in a resolver.
However, all feature dependencies in a single resolver
need to originate in the same root namespace:

<TipGood>Requiring features from the same root namespace</TipGood>

```py
@online
def get_name_sim(a: User.email, b: User.name) -> User.email_name_match:
    return len(set(a) & set(b)) / len(set(a) | set(b))
```

Here, we incorrectly request features from the root namespaces
of `Transfer` and `User`:

<TipBad>Requiring features from different root namespaces</TipBad>

```py
@online
def txn_email_sim(
    email: User.email,
    memo: Transfer.memo,
) -> Transfer.email_in_memo:
    return email in memo
```

If you want to require features from namespaces,
you can use [has-one](/docs/has-one) or
[has-many](/docs/has-many) relationships.

<TipGood>Requiring features from different root namespaces using a relationship</TipGood>

```py
@online
def txn_email_sim(
    email: Transfer.user.email,
    memo: Transfer.memo,
) -> Transfer.email_in_memo:
    return email in memo
```

### Has-one dependencies

#### Scalar has-one

You can also require features joined to a
[feature class](/docs/features) through
[has-one](/docs/has-one) relationships.
For example, if users in your system have bank accounts,
and you wanted to compare the name on the user's bank account
to the user's name, you could require the user's name and
the account's title through the user:

```py
@online
def name_sim(title: User.account.title, name: User.full_name) -> User.name_sim:
    return len(set(title) & set(name)) / len(set(title) | set(name))
```

You can also require all scalars on the user:

```py
from chalk import online, Now

@online
def get_txn_name_match(
    memo: Transaction.memo,
    user: Transaction.user,
) -> User.profile.age:
    return (
        len(set(memo) & set(user.full_name)) /
        len(set(memo) | set(user.full_name)
    )
```

Chalk will materialize all scalar features on the user
before calling this function.
If you want to pull only a few features of the user,
require each directly:

```py
@online
def get_txn_name_match(
    memo: Transaction.memo,
    full_name: Transaction.user.full_name,
) -> User.profile.age:
    return (
        len(set(memo) & set(full_name)) /
        len(set(memo) | set(full_name)
    )
```

#### Optional has-one

Has-one relationships can also be
[declared as optional](/docs/has-one#optional-relationships).
You may also require feature through optional relationships,
but the types for all of those optional features will become
optional. Consider the below example:

```py
from chalk.features import features, online

@features
class Account:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    balance: float  # Non-optional balance

@features
class User:
    id: int
    account: Account | None
    has_high_balance: bool

@online
def has_high_bal(balance: User.account.balance) -> User.has_high_balance:
    # Balance will be "float | None", because User.account is optional
    if balance is None:
        return False
    return balance > 1000
```

The resolver in this example receives an optional `float`,
even though `balance` is not an optional field on `Account`.
The optional is added because the user may not have an account,
in which case the resolver will receive `None` for the balance.

#### Nested has-one

You can also traverse nested [has-one](/docs/has-one)
relationships in the same manner as
[requiring a single has-one](#has-one-dependencies).

Consider a schema where users have a feature class of profile information,
and the user's profile has an identity feature class, which in turn
has the age of the user's email.
You can require the email age feature as below:

```py
@online
def email_score(
    email_age: User.profile.identity.email_age
) -> User.email_score:
    return (
        1 if email_age < 30 else
        0.5 if email_age < 60 else
        0
    )
```

However, you cannot access nested relationships without
explicit asking for them.

<TipBad>Accessing a transitive relationship from a dependency.</TipBad>

```py
@online
def fn(acct: User.account) -> ...:
    acct.balance           # Ok
    acct.institution.name  # Error!
```

Instead, you can require the nested relationship directly
and access any of its scalar features.

<TipGood>Directly requiring the transitive relationship.</TipGood>

```py
@online
def fn(ins: User.account.institution, acct: User.account) -> ...:
    acct.balance  # Ok
    ins.name      # Ok
```

The semantics of
[optional has-one dependencies](#optional-has-one)
carry over to nested has-one dependencies.
If you traverse an optional relationship,
then all downstream attributes will become optional.

### Has-many dependencies

#### Scalar has-many

You can also require [has-many relationships](/docs/has-many)
as inputs to your resolver:

```py
@online
def txn_count(transfers: User.transfers) -> User.count_transfers:
    return len(transfers)
```

You receive a [Chalk DataFrame](/docs/dataframe),
which supports
[projections](/docs/dataframe#projections),
[filtering](/docs/dataframe#filters), and
[aggregations](/docs/dataframe#aggregations),
among other operations.

#### Projections

By default, Chalk will materialize all scalar features
on the `Transfer` feature class before calling your resolver.
As an optimization hint, you can specify which features from
the transfers that you'd like Chalk to materialize before calling
the function. For example, if there were expensive features
to compute on the transfer, you could scope the features
to only the set you need:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.memo]) -> ...:
    transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()      # Ok
    transfers[Transfer.from_institution]  # Error: filtered out above
```

The error above is surfaced statically
by our [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup).

#### Filtering

You can apply filters to the has-many inputs of resolvers:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount > 100]) -> ...:
```

[Filters](/docs/dataframe#filters) can be composed with
[projections](/docs/dataframe#projections) following the semantics
of the Chalk `DataFrame`.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount > 100, Transfer.memo]) -> ...:
```

Filters can also be used on features through has-one relationships.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.bank.location == "USA"]) -> ...:
```

More on projection and filtering [here](/docs/dataframe#composing-projections-and-filters)

#### Has-many through has-one

Has-many relationships can be required through has-one relationships:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.account.transfers) -> ...:
```

As with [scalar has-many dependencies](#scalar-has-many),
you can scope down the scalar features on the transfer
to only those required:

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.account.transfers[Transfer.amount]) -> ...:
    transfers[Transfer.amount].sum()      # Ok
    transfers[Transfer.from_institution]  # Error: filtered out above
```

#### Has-many through optional-has-one

If the has-one relationship that you're traversing is
[optional](/docs/has-one#optional-relationships),
then the `transfers` argument in the example above will
either be `None` or a [Chalk DataFrame](/docs/dataframe).

#### Has-one through has-many

You can also select columns through nested has-one relationships that would not normally materialize.

```py
@online
def fn(transfers: User.transfers[Transfer.amount, Transfer.bank.name]) -> ...:
```

In the above example, if there was a has-one relationship between `Transfer` and `Bank`,
we can fetch any scalar feature from `Bank` as well for the `DataFrame`.
Note that the `Bank.name` column would _not_ materialize with the simple `transfers: User.transfers` typing,
since this typing only materializes scalar features in the root namespace.

#### Has-many through has-many

Has-many relationships can be required through other has-many relationships.

For example, consider the following feature definitions for `User`, `Account`, and `Transaction`,
where a user can have many accounts, each with many transactions.

```py
from chalk.features import features, has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Transaction:
    id: str
    account_id: "Account.id"
    amount: float

@features
class Account:
    id: str
    user_id: "User.id"
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]

@features
class User:
    id: str
    total_spent: float
    accounts: DataFrame[Account]
```

We can resolve the `total_spent` feature on `User` by computing the sum of transaction
amounts across all of a user's accounts, as shown below.

```python
@online
def get_total_spent(
    txns: User.accounts.transactions[Transaction.amount]
) -> User.total_spent:
    return txns.sum()
```

### Time dependencies

To set a time-based dependency in your resolver, you can use the `Now` keyword. Resolvers with a dependency on `Now`
can use the input times passed in at query-time to compute either scalar or DataFrame outputs.

```python
from chalk import online, DataFrame, Now
from chalk.features import features
from datetime import datetime

@features
class Account:
    id: str
    balance: float
    updated: datetime

@online
def get_daily_balance(now: Now) -> DataFrame[Account]:
    return DataFrame([
        Account(id="1", balance=100, updated=now),
        Account(id="2", balance=200, updated=now),
    ])
```

Read more about time-based dependencies [here](/docs/time).

## Outputs

Python resolvers can output either scalar features or a DataFrame of features.

### Scalar output

#### Single output

To return a single feature from a resolver,
set the return type annotation to the feature you
want to resolve:

```py
from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    employer: str

@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> User.name:
    return "Jennifer Doudna"
```

Equivalently, you can wrap the return value in the `User` class:

```diff-py
@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> User.name:
-   return "Jennifer Doudna"
+   return User(name="Jennifer Doudna")
```

#### Multiple outputs

To return multiple features, return an
[instance of the feature class](/docs/features#constructing-feature-classes).
In the type signature, specify
the `Features[...]` class, parameterized
by the features that you pass to the feature class.

```python
@online
def resolve(u: User.id) -> Features[User.name, User.employer]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

You only need to pass
[a subset of the features](/docs/features#constructing-feature-classes)
to the constructor for the feature class.

The [editor plugin](/docs/editor-setup) will check
that the type annotation you assign to the resolver
matches subset of features passed to the constructor
of the feature class.

#### All features

To return all features of a class,
use `Features[...]` around the feature class.

```py
@online
def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

If your resolver takes input features, those features are not
considered as part of the output features.

Note that the `id` feature is not returned from the function.

This definition is equivalent to:

```diff-py
@online
- def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User]:
+ def get_user(u: User.id) -> Features[User.name, User.employer]:
    return User(
        name="Jennifer Doudna",
        employer="University of California, Berkeley"
    )
```

However, you may want to return _almost_ all features of a class.
Writing out all the features can be tedious and error-prone.
You can subtract features from a feature class
using the `-` operator:

```py
from chalk.features import Features, ...

@online
def get_all_users(id: User.id) -> Features[User] - User.name:
    return User(employer="University of California, Berkeley")
```

Here, both the `id` feature and the `name` feature are not returned,
which leaves only the `employer` feature.

### DataFrame output

You can also output many instances of a feature class from a resolver
by specifying a [DataFrame](/docs/dataframe) as the return type of
the function:

```py
@offline
def get_events() -> DataFrame[Transfer.uuid, Transfer.amount, Transfer.ts]:
    return DataFrame.read_csv(...)
```

Say you wanted to return many instances of a feature class, including nested features,
from a resolver, then you can the DataFrame class for your return type and in your
resolver definition.

```python
@online
def get_user_employer_information(id: User.id) -> Dataframe[User.id, User.name, User.employer.name, User.employer.category]:
    return DataFrame([
        User(
            id="1",
            name="Jennifer Doudna",
            employer=Employer(
                name="University of California, Berkeley",
                category="Education"
            )
        )
    ])
```

For more info on how to load batch data,
see the [Data Sources](/docs/sql) sections.
`DataFrame`-returning resolvers don't need inputs.

#### All features

To return all features of a class in a DataFrame,
use `DataFrame[...]` class around the feature class:

```py
@online
def get_all_users() -> DataFrame[User]:
    return DataFrame([
        User(
            name="Jennifer Doudna",
            employer="University of California, Berkeley"
        )
    ])
```

#### Other DataFrame-returning resolvers

Imagine a scalar feature you'd like to backfill over many thousands of primary keys and historical
times. `DataFrame`-returning resolvers can dramatically reduce the computation time due to its
vectorized handling.

```py
@offline
def get_new_feature_as_dataframe(
    df: DataFrame[Transaction.id, ...]
) -> DataFrame[Transaction.id, Transaction.new_feature]:
```

The above resolver runs faster on a thousand rows
than the equivalent scalar resolver ran a thousand times.

Chalk also supports relationship-returning resolvers that enable users to
return a `DataFrame` belonging to a has-many relationship.

```py
@offline
def relationship_returning_resolver(
    df: User.transactions[Transaction.id, Transaction.amount, Transaction.description],
    user_type: User.type
) -> User.transactions[Transaction.id, Transaction.transaction_type]:
```

Just make sure that the return `DataFrame`s do not have duplicate rows.
That means no two rows should have the same primary key, or primary key & timestamp combinations if the
feature time is also returned.

## Testing

To test your Python resolvers, you can set up [unit tests](/docs/unit-tests), construct
[integration tests](/docs/integration-tests) or iterate on a branch.
