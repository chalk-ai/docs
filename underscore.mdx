## Underscore expressions

Underscore expressions can be used to define and
resolve features that can be derived from operations on other features

Consider the feature class `RocketEngine` define below:

```python
from chalk.features import features

@features
class RocketEngine:
    id: int
    mass: float
    thrust: float
```

Suppose we wanted to define a feature called `density` and resolve it as `mass / volume`,
we can use the underscore feature definition syntax as follows

```diff-py
- from chalk.features import features
+ from chalk.features import _, features

@features
class RocketEngine:
    id: int
    mass: float
    thrust: float

+   # Defining density using an underscore expression
+   density: float = _.mass / _.volume
```

Note that `_` is a reference to the containing feature class `RocketEngine` and should
be used to reference features contained in the same feature class.

The expression `_.mass / _.volume` is equivalent to `RocketEngine.mass / RocketEngine.volume`


## Dataframes

Underscore can also be used to define expressions with [`DataFrame`](/docs/dataframe) features.

In the example below, we will define two new feature classes `Astronaut` and `RocketShip`

```python
from chalk.features import features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Astronaut:
    id: int
    name: str
    height: float
    mass: float
    ship_id: int

@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)
```
### Projections

Suppose we wanted to define a feature called `total_mass` on `RocketShip` and resolve
it as the sum of the masses of the astronauts on the ship and the mass of the engine.

Using the underscore syntax, we can define `total_mass` as follows

```diff-py
- from chalk.features import features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame
+ from chalk.features import _, features, has_one, has_many, DataFrame

@features
class Astronaut:
    id: int
    name: str
    height: float
    mass: float
    ship_id: int

@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)

+   # Defining total_mass using an underscore expression
+   total_mass: float = _.engine.mass + _.astronauts[_.mass].sum()
```

Here we used the underscore syntax do a [projection](/docs/dataframe#projections) on the `mass` column on the
astronauts `DataFrame`.


### Filters

Underscores can also be used to define [filters](/docs/dataframe#filters) on `DataFrame` features.

For example, suppose we wanted to define a feature called `count_tall_astronauts` on `RocketShip`.
We could define the feature as follows

```diff-py
@features
class RocketShip:
    id: int
    engine_id: int

    # `has_one` relationship with `RocketEngine`
    engine: RocketEngine = has_one(lambda: RocketShip.engine_id == RocketEngine.id)

    # `has_many` relationship with `Astronaut`
    astronauts: DataFrame[Astronaut] = has_many(lambda: Astronaut.ship_id == RocketShip.id)

    # Defining total_mass using an underscore expression
    total_mass: float = _.engine.mass + _.astronauts[_.mass].sum()

+   # Filtering on the `height` column
+   count_tall_astronauts = _.astronauts[_.height > 2.0].count()
```

### Column definitions

Underscore expressions can be used in conjunction with [`with_column`](/api-docs#DataFrame.with_column) to define new columns on a `DataFrame`.

In the example below, we define a new column on `astronauts_df` called `bmi` which is the ratio of `mass` to `height` squared.

```python

astronauts_df = DataFrame(
    {
        "id": [1, 2, 3],
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
        "height": [1.5, 1.8, 2.0],
        "mass": [50.0, 70.0, 80.0],
    }
)

# Defining a new column called `bmi` using an underscore expression
astronauts_df = astronauts_df.with_column(
    _.bmi, _.mass / _.height ** 2
)
```
