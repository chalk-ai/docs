description: Using underscore expressions to define features

---

## Overview

Underscore expressions are used to derive features from operations on other features. In feature definitions, `_`
represents a reference to the containing feature class and is used to access other features in the same instance. In
addition to arithmetic operations, underscore expressions can also be used to filter and aggregate data.

Underscore expressions are useful because Chalk statically analyzes and optimizes them, leading to better performance
when compared to equivalent Python resolvers. They are also useful for succinctly defining common features, such as the
number of times a user failed a login attempt over the past 30 days or the total amount spent at a given merchant.

## Arithmetic

In this example, we have a Transaction feature class with `total` and `sales_tax` features and we want to define
`subtotal` as `total` minus `sales_tax`. Instead of writing a Python resolver, we can resolve `subtotal` with an
underscore expression:

```diff-py
- from chalk import online
+ from chalk.features import _, features

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    total: float
    sales_tax: float
+   subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax

- @online
- def get_subtotal(total: Transaction.total, sales_tax: Transaction.sales_tax) -> Transaction.subtotal:
-     return total - sales_tax
```

## Conditions and filters

DataFrame features can be [filtered](/docs/dataframe#filters) with underscore expressions.

Extending our `Transaction` example, we can create a `User` feature class with a [has-many](/docs/has-many) relationship
to `Transaction`. Then, we can define a feature representing the number of large purchases by referencing the existing
`User.transactions` feature:

```diff-py
from chalk.features import _, features, DataFrame

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
+   user_id: "User.id"
    total: float
    sales_tax: float
    subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax

+ @features
+ class User:
+    id: int
+    # implicit has-many relationship with Transaction due to `user_id` above
+    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
+    num_large_transactions: int = _.transactions[_.total > 1000].count()
```

The object referenced by `_` changes depending on its current scope. In this code, the `_` in `_.transactions`
references the `User` object. Within the DataFrame filter, the `_` in `_.total` references each `Transaction` object as
each one is evaluated. The `count` aggregation is covered in the next section.

## Projections and aggregations

DataFrame features support [projection](/docs/dataframe#projections) with underscore expressions, which produce a new
DataFrame scoped down to the referenced columns. DataFrames can be aggregated after eligible columns are selected.

With our `Transaction` example, we already saw a `count` aggregation for counting the number of large transactions. We
can add another aggregation for computing the user's total spend:

```diff-py
from chalk.features import _, features, DataFrame

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: "User.id"
    total: float
    sales_tax: float
    subtotal: float = _.total - _.sales_tax

@features
class User:
    id: int
    # implicit has-many relationship with Transaction due to `user_id` above
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    num_large_transactions: int = _.transactions[_.total > 1000].count()
+   total_spend: float = _.transactions[_.total].sum()
```

To compute `User.total_spend`, we needed to create a projection of the `User.transactions` DataFrame limited to only the
`Transaction.total` column so that the `sum` aggregation could work. In contrast, no projection was needed for
`num_large_transaction`'s `count` aggregation because `count` works on DataFrames with any number of columns.

## All supported operations

### Arithmetic
* Addition: `+`
* Subtraction: `-`
* Multiplication: `*`
* Division: `/`

### Conditions
* Greater than: `>`
* Greater than or equal: `>=`
* Less than: `<`
* Less than or equal: `<=`
* Equal: `==`
* Not equal: `!=`
* Boolean and: `&`
* Boolean or: `|`

Do not use Python's `and`, `or`, `not`, or `is` operators in underscore expressions. Python does not allow these
operators to be overridden, so they will not work with Chalk's underscore expressions.

### Aggregations

Aggregation functions have varying behavior when handling None values and empty DataFrames.  If an aggregation function
says None values are skipped in the table below, it will consider a DataFrame with only None values as empty.

| Function | `None` values | Empty DataFrame | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sum` | Skipped | Returns `0` | |
| `min` | Skipped | Returns `None` | |
| `max` | Skipped | Returns `None` | |
| `mean` | Skipped | Returns `None` | Feature type must be `float` or <code>float &#124; None</code>. `None` values are skipped, meaning they are not included in the mean calculation.  |
|`count` | Included | Returns `0` |
|`any` | Skipped | Returns `False` | |
|`all` | Skipped | Returns `True` | |
|`std` | Skipped | See notes | Standard deviation. Requires at least 2 values. For DataFrames with less than 2 values, returns `None`.<br/><br/>Aliases: `stddev`, `stddev_sample`, `std_sample`. |
|`var` | Skipped | See notes | Variance. Same requirements as `std`.<br/><br/>Alias: `var_sample`. |
|`approx_count_distinct` | Skipped | Returns `0` | |
|`approx_percentile` | Skipped | Returns `None` | Takes one argument, `quantile`, expected to be a float in the range `[0, 1]`.<br/><br/>Example: `approx_percentile(0.75)` returns a value approximately equal to the 75th percentile of the not-`None` values in the DataFrame. |

For aggregations that can return `None`, either mark the feature as optional (for example, by setting the feature type
to `float | None`) or use [`coalesce`](/api-docs#coalesce) to fall back to a default value.
