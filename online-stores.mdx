When setting up a new environment, Chalk provides several options for

Chalk uses several storage technologies

Postgres (Redshift, Cloud SQL)
Redis
DynamoDB
bigtable

Online Store Options
1. Redis or DynamoDB
- Tradeoffs:
- Performance: High throughput and low latency are achieved with Redis, making it suitable for key-value access patterns.
- Scalability: DynamoDB is highly scalable but may introduce some latency due to its distributed nature.
- Cost: Redis can be more cost-effective for smaller datasets, while DynamoDBâ€™s pricing can grow with large-scale data usage.
2. BigTable (if considering horizontal scalability)
- Tradeoffs:
- Scalability: Excellent for massive datasets and high-throughput applications.
- Cost: May be more expensive than traditional key-value stores depending on the usage pattern and data size.
Offline Store Options
1. Snowflake, BigQuery, or Delta Lake
- Tradeoffs:
- Storage & Computation: Optimized for storing historical feature values and performing batch queries. They are excellent for analytics and larger datasets.
- Cost & Complexity: Snowflake and BigQuery can incur costs based on usage, and managing large datasets may require more complex query optimizations compared to simpler storage solutions.
2. TimescaleDB (if considering time-series data)
- Tradeoffs:
- Time-Series Capabilities: Great for time-series data with robust querying capabilities.
- Cost: Can offer savings for specific data access patterns compared to more general-purpose data warehouses.
General Considerations
- Feature Caching: Using an online store allows for the usage of max_staleness, enabling faster response times and cache hits.
- Data Latency & Freshness: The choice of the online store impacts how fresh data is served. For real-time applications, using a fast online store with caching features is vital.
- Integration Complexity: Some options may require additional setup or configuration, depending on the selected technology stack and your environment's architecture.
