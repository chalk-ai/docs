So far, we've mapped SQL tables into feature classes. But there's a lot more we can do with
Chalk. In this step, we'll add features to our `Account` and `User` feature classes
that are gathered from API calls and computed downstream of other features.

---

## Derived Features

We've noticed that some fraudsters try to link
stolen accounts to our platform and attempt to
transfer money through our system.
To detect this behavior, we want to compute a
similarity score between the user's name and the
account's title.

We'll start by adding this new feature, `account_name_match`,
to our `User` feature class.

```diff-py src/models.py
@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    account: "Account"

+   # The similarity between the user's name and the account's title.
+   account_name_match: float
```

Next, we'll define a resolver that computes this feature.
We'll use
[Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
to compute the similarity score.

```python src/resolvers.py
from src.models import User
from chalk import online

@online
def account_name_match(
    title: User.account.title,
    name: User.name,
) -> User.account_name_match:
    """Docstrings show up in the Chalk dashboard"""
    intersection = set(title) & set(name)
    union = set(title) | set(name)
    return len(intersection) / len(union)
```

The `@online` decorator tells Chalk that this resolver should be called
in realtime when the `User.account_name_match` feature is requested.
Our feature dependencies are declared in the function signature
as `User.account.title` and `User.name`.
Chalk will automatically retrieve
`User.account_id` and `User.name`
from our
[`user.chalk.sql`](https://github.com/chalk-ai/fraud-example/blob/main/src/user.chalk.sql)
resolver. Then, using this account id,
Chalk will retrieve `Account.title`
from the online store, where it has been cached from our cron run of the
[`balance.chalk.sql`](https://github.com/chalk-ai/fraud-example/blob/main/src/balance.chalk.sql)
resolver.

### Testing

Resolvers are callable functions, so we can test them like any other Python function.
Let's test our new resolver by writing a
[unit test](https://github.com/chalk-ai/fraud-example/blob/main/tests/test_name_match.py):

```python tests/test_name_match.py
from src.resolvers import account_name_match

def test_names_match():
    """Resolvers can be unit tested exactly as you would expect.

    Here, the `account_name_match` resolver should return 1.0
    because the `title` and `name` are identical.
    """
    assert 1 == account_name_match(
        title="John Coltrane",
        name="John Coltrane",
    )

def test_names_completely_different():
    """The `account_name_match` resolver should return 0
    because the `title` and `name` don't share any characters.
    """
    assert 0 == account_name_match(
        title="John Coltrane",
        name="Zyx",
    )
````

You can read more about testing resolvers in the
[API docs](/docs/unit-tests).

## API Calls

Any Python function can be used as a resolver.
This means that we can call APIs to compute features.
Let's add a feature that computes the user's FICO score
from our credit scoring vendor,
[Experian](https://experian.com).

As before, we'll first add the features that we want to compute:

```diff-py src/models.py
+ from chalk.features import features

@features
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    account_name_match: float

+   # The fraud score, as provided by a third-party vendor.
+   fico_score: int = feature(min=300, max=850, strict=True)
+
+   # Tags from our credit scoring vendor.
+   credit_score_tags: list[str]
```

We are adding
[strict validation](/docs/validation)
to our `fico_score` feature
to ensure that we only store and utilize valid FICO scores.

Now, we can write a resolver to fetch the user's FICO score from Experian.

```python src/resolvers.py
from src.models import User
from src.mocks import experian
from chalk.features import online, Features

@online
def get_fraud_score(
    name: User.name,
    email: User.email,
) -> Features[User.fico_score, User.credit_score_tags]:
    response = experian.get_credit_score(name, email)

    # We don't need to provide all the features for
    # the `User` class, only the ones that we want to update.
    return User(
        fico_score=response['fico_score'],
        credit_score_tags=response['tags'],
    )
```

Here, we are returning two features of the user,
`User.fico_score` and `User.credit_score_tags`.
We use the [`Features`](/api-docs#Features) type to indicate
which feature we expect to return.
Also note that we are initializing the `User` class with
only the features that we want to update.
This partial initialization is the primary difference
between Python's
[`@dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
and Chalk's
[`@features`](/api-docs#features).

## Deploying

Finally, we'll want to deploy our new resolvers.
As before, we can check our work by using a branch
deployment:

```bash
$ chalk apply --branch tutorial
✓ Found resolvers
✓ Deployed branch
```

We can then query our new features:

```bash
$ chalk query --branch tutorial  \
              --in     user.id=1 \
              --out    user.name_match_score
```
