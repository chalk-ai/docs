Chalk enables users to convert and aggregate streaming messages into Chalk features in realtime.

The first step towards building a streaming environment with Chalk
is creating a streaming source from one of Chalk's integrations.
Chalk supports [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/),
and [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) for streaming.
Like other integration sources, source parameters and credentials
may be specified in either the dashboard or the source instantiation in code.
See more information on [KafkaSource](/api-docs#KafkaSource),
[KinesisSource](/api-docs#KinesisSource), and [PubSubSource](/api-docs#PubSubSource) in the API docs.

```py
from chalk.streams import KafkaSource, KinesisSource, PubSubSource

kafka_topic = KafkaSource(name="transactions")
kinesis_topic = KinesisSource(name="transactions")
pubsub_topic = PubSubSource(name="transactions")
```

Now, let's set up the Chalk features you'd like to materialize upon stream message ingestion.

```py
from chalk.features import features, Features

@features(max_staleness="1d")
class Transaction:
    id: str
    amount: float
```

Streaming resolvers produce feature values that are persisted to the offline store. Similar
to other resolvers, streaming resolvers can also persist computed feature values to the online
store by setting `etl_offline_to_online=True` or `max_staleness` in the `@features` decorator.

Chalk supports two kinds of streaming resolvers: mapping and windowed.
This page focuses on mapping resolvers, which create one Chalk feature instance per message.
Windowed streaming is covered in the [windowed streaming](/docs/windowed-streaming) page.

This is an example of a mapping resolver that maps from a `bytes` message to an instance of `Transaction`.

```py
from chalk.streams import stream
from chalk.features import Features

@stream(source=source)
def stream_resolver(message: bytes) -> Features[Transaction.id, Transaction.value]:
    id, value = some_bytes_processing_step(message)
    return Transaction(id=id, value=value)
```

In this resolver, we pass in the raw bytes from the stream.
If you're using JSON as the encoding for messages on your topic,
you can optionally specify a
[Pydantic Model](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
as a wrapper for messages on the topic.
Chalk will validate the encoding against the model.

```py
from chalk.streams import KafkaSource
from chalk.features import features, Features
from pydantic import BaseModel

@features(max_staleness="1d")
class Transaction:
    id: str
    amount: float

kafka_topic = KafkaSource(name="transactions")

class TransactionTopicMessage(BaseModel):
    id: str
    amount: float

@stream(source=kafka_topic)
def stream_resolver(
    message: TransactionTopicMessage,
) -> Features[Transaction.id, Transaction.value]:
    return Transaction(id=message.id, value=message.value)
```

---

## Late arrivals

Chalk lets you configure whether resolvers should accept late-arriving stream messages.
By default, Chalk attempts to consider any late arriving in stream resolvers.
However, you can tune this behavior with the `late_arrival_deadline` argument
to you stream source:

```python
from chalk.streams import KafkaSource

# By default, the late_arrival_deadline is set to "**infinity**".
source = KafkaSource(late_arrival_deadline="**30m**")
```

If a message is older than the `late_arrival_deadline` when it is consumed,
its resolver will not run.

---

## Parsing

Sometimes, messages must be processed before resolver execution.
Streaming resolvers can optionally support a `parse` function that preprocesses messages.
Possible use cases include

- Ingesting bytes and preprocessing before inputting data into a `BaseModel`.
- Optionally skipping resolver execution for certain messages.
- Re-keying for windowed stream aggregations.

The parse function runs before the resolver, and can transform the message into a format that the
stream resolver understands. If the parse function returns `None`, the resolver will be skipped.

A simple parse function can ingest bytes into a `BaseModel`, which will be used as input for the streaming resolver.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TransactionMessage(BaseModel):
    id: str
    value: str

def parse_bytes(data: bytes) -> TransactionMessage:
    id, amount = some_bytes_processing_step(data)
    return TransactionMessage(id=id, amount=amount)

@stream(source=source, parse=parse_bytes)
def stream_resolver(message: TransactionMessage) -> Features[Transaction.id, Transaction.amount]:
    return Transaction(id=message.id, amount=message.amount)
```

In the below example, only `UserEventMessage`s which have a `click_event` property will be processed by `resolve_clicks`.
Those where it is equal to `None` will not be processed, and skipped entirely.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Child messages
class UserLoginEvent(BaseModel):
    ...

class UserClickEvent(BaseModel):
    ...

# Parent message contains one of the child message types
class UserEventMessage(BaseModel):
    login_event: UserLoginEvent | None = None
    click_event: UserClickEvent | None = None

def get_click_event(event: UserEventMessage) -> UserClickEvent | None:
    return event.click_event # can be None

@stream(source=str_source, parse=get_click_event)
def resolve_clicks(message: UserClickEvent) -> Features[...]:
    ...
```

## Full example

In this example, each of the messages from our Kafka source will be converted to a `StreamFeature` instance.
Our streaming message, embodied by `KafkaMessage`, contains a string representation of a naive datetime
we would like to convert to a timezoned datetime.

Upon message arrival, the bytes are first parsed into `KafkaMessage`,
then run through the parse function `parse_message`.
The intermediate output `ParsedMessage` is fed to the `stream_resolver`, which produces Chalk features.
Because we have specified max staleness and `etl_offline_to_online`,
we can expect `StreamFeature` to be queryable in both online and offline contexts.

```py
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from dateutil import parser
from pydantic import BaseModel
from chalk.features import features, Features
from chalk.streams import stream, KafkaSource


source = KafkaSource(name="...")

class KafkaMessage(BaseModel):
    id: str
    value: str
    naive_timestamp_str: str

class ParsedMessage(BaseModel):
    id: str
    value: str
    event_timestamp: datetime


@features(max_staleness="1d", etl_offline_to_online=True)
class StreamFeature:
    id: str
    value: str
    event_timestamp: datetime

def parse_message(kafka_message: KafkaMessage) -> ParsedMessage:
    parsed_timestamp: datetime = parser.parse(kafka_message.naive_timestamp_str)
    timezoned_timestamp = parsed_timestamp.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    return ParsedMessage(
        id=kafka_message.id,
        value=kafka_message.value,
        event_timestamp=timezoned_timestamp
    )

@stream(source=source, parse=parse_message)
def kafka_stream_resolver(message: ParsedMessage) -> Features[StreamFeature.id, StreamFeature.value]:
    return StreamFeature(id=message.id, value=message.value, event_timestamp=message.event_timestamp)
```

## Testing Stream Resolvers

Testing stream resolvers can be difficult:
streaming is a complex paradigm that involves multiple services that can be difficult to replicate.

If your streaming resolvers error in production,
the errors will be logged and displayed on the dashboard for the resolver.
But if you're looking to unit test your stream resolvers, you have a few options.

One option is to feed dummy data into the resolver locally.
Like regular resolvers, stream resolvers should be unit-testable as regular Python functions.


```py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from chalk.features import features, Features
from chalk.streams import stream, KinesisSource

kinesis_source = KinesisSource(name="...")

class KinesisMessage(BaseModel):
    payment_id: str
    amount: int

@features(max_staleness="1d", etl_offline_to_online=True)
class KinesisPaymentFeatures:
    id: str
    amount: int

@stream(source=kinesis_source)
def kinesis_stream_resolver(
    message: KinesisMessage,
) -> Features[KinesisPaymentFeatures.id, KinesisPaymentFeatures.amount]:
    return KinesisPaymentFeatures(id=message.payment_id, amount=message.amount)


model_example = KinesisMessage(id="1", amount=5)
result = kinesis_stream_resolver(model_example)
assert result.id == "1"
```

However, if you have a parse function,
custom timestamps, or other advanced functionality you want to test,
you may have to send messages to the streaming server.
Streaming resolver updates require a full [`chalk apply`](/cli/apply) to update the 
streaming server for testing. 
Read more on how to use the `ChalkClient` to test streaming resolvers
[here](/api-docs#ChalkClient.test_streaming_resolver)). This will pass messages
through your resolvers without persistence, and will return you a Polars DataFrame
with your output data for inspection.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from chalk.features import features, Features
from chalk.streams import stream, KinesisSource
from chalk.client import ChalkClient

kinesis_source = KinesisSource(name="...")

class KinesisMessage(BaseModel):
    payment_id: str
    amount: int

@features(max_staleness="1d", etl_offline_to_online=True)
class KinesisPaymentFeatures:
    id: str
    amount: int

# Note the use of a parse function here.
def parse_bytes(b: bytes) -> KinesisMessage:
    return KinesisMessage.parse_raw(b)

@stream(source=kinesis_source, parse=parse_bytes)
def kinesis_stream_resolver_with_parse(
    message: KinesisMessage,
) -> Features[KinesisPaymentFeatures.id, KinesisPaymentFeatures.amount]:
    return KinesisPaymentFeatures(id=message.payment_id, amount=message.amount)

client = ChalkClient()
messages = [KinesisMessage(payment_id=str(i), amount=i * 10).json().encode('utf-8') for i in range(10)]
resp = client.test_streaming_resolver(
    resolver="kinesis_stream_resolver_with_parse",
    message_bodies=messages,
)
print(resp.features)
```

## Online / Offline Storage

With mapping streaming resolvers, as with Python and SQL resolvers, Chalk will persist values to the
offline store if there is an offline store deployed in the environment. You would be able to access
these values with an [offline query](/docs/query-offline) or through the [SQL Interface](/docs/sql-interface).
If you would like to query features as resolved by a stream resolver, then the feature must have
`etl_offline_to_online=True` and `max_staleness` set in the feature definition. With these two settings, the
Chalk streaming server will also persist feature values to the online store, such that you can access recent
feature values through the online query pathway.

*Note: if you would like
to resolve features in a feature class with a materialized aggregation defined as part of the feature class,
you should apply the `max_staleness` specifically to the features for which you would like to [online query](/docs/query-online).
Otherwise, the aggregation will return the last observed value based on the max_staleness, rather than the actual
computed aggregation value.*
