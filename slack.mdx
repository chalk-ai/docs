Chalk supports integration with [Slack](https://slack.com) for alerting.

---

## Connect using OAuth

To connect Chalk with a Slack channel for alerting,
you'll need to grant Chalk permission to view and
write to your Slack workspace.

Navigate to the settings page for the Chalk environment
you want to send alerts to a Slack channel.
Click the "Slack" tab, and then "Add to Slack".
Chalk can now post to Slack channels!

## Add Slack Channels

Chalk can only post alerts to channels that you enable.
You can see the list of known pages on the "Slack Settings" page for your environment.
To add a new channel for alerting, select it from the drop-down and press "Add New".
