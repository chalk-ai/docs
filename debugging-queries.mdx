title: Debugging Queries
description: Learn techniques for debugging online and offline queries

Online and offline queries can fuse data from multiple sources, and the structure of how data flows
through queries can be complex. Chalk has a number of tools to help you debug queries. In this section, we'll
explore how to use these tools on a few simple features and resolvers.

First, we'll define our feature classes. We'll work with a `User` and a `Transaction` object, representing
users performing financial transactions. In this scenario, we'll write a simple aggregation that has a bug
in its definition, and explore various ways to debug that issue.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from chalk import features

@features
class Transaction:
    id: int
    user_id: int
    amount: float
    ts: datetime

@features
class User:
    id: int
    sum_transaction_amount: float
```

Then, we'll define simple online resolvers to ingest user and transaction data from a postgres database:

```sql
-- (users.chalk.sql)
-- resolves: User
-- source: postgres

select id from users
```

```sql
-- (transactions.chalk.sql)
-- resolves: Transaction
-- source: postgres

select id, user_id, amount, ts from transactions
```

Next, we'll write a simple (buggy) aggregation resolver to compute the sum of a user's transactions:

```python
from chalk import online

@online
def sum_transaction_amount(txns: User.transaction[Transaction.amount]) -> User.sum_transaction_amount:
    return txns[Transaction.amount].count() # this 'count' is a bug! we'll debug it shortly.
```

Notice that we've defined this aggregation with a bug! We're actually computing the `count` of the User's
Transactions, rather than the `sum` of their amounts.

Let's run a query --

```python
data = ChalkClient().query(input={User.id: 1}, output=[User.sum_transaction_amount])

print(data.get_value(User.sum_transaction_amount))

# Outputs 100!!
```

Whoops! Because we have prior knowledge of our data, we know that `100` is the wrong value for User `1`s transaction sum.
Let's debug this issue.

## Query Plan Visualizer

The query plan visualizer is a tool that allows you to see the structure of a query, and also inspect the data that
flows through it.

To make full use of the query plan visualizer, we can re-execute the previous query with the `store_plan_stages=True` kwarg.
This stores all of the data that passes through each stage of the query plan.

```python
ChalkClient.query(input={User.id: 1}, output=[User.sum_transactions], store_plan_stages=True)

# -or to debug multiple users at once-
ChalkClient.offline_query(input={User.id: [1,2,3]}, output=[User.sum_transactions], store_plan_stages=True)
```

Then, we navigate to the 'Queries' tab in the web dashboard. Our query appear under the
'Online' or 'Offline' tab depending on which kind of query. Here we'll take a look at the online query, and we
can see the structure of the query:

![Query Plan Visualizer](/img/debugging/query_plan_1.png)

The query plan visualizer shows us the structure of the query. Note that the `transaction` resolver is executed
to fetch the transactions for each user, and then the `sum_transaction_amount` resolver is executed to compute
the sum.

We can also see the data that flows through the query. Clicking on the `transaction` resolver shows us the output
of the resolver:

![Transaction Output](/img/debugging/query_plan_2.png)

Notice that the sum of the transaction amounts is definitely not `100`! By inspecting the `transaction.amount` column
we notice that the sum should be much larger. If we were paying attention, we'd probably notice that our (incorrect) output
`100` happens to be identical to the `count` summary of the transaction resolver, which would be a good hint that
our aggregation is actually computing the `count` of the transactions, rather than the `sum` of their amounts.

However, if we're having a slow day and don't notice that the aggregation happens to match the count, we have more
tools we can use to debug. The next section will walk through how to execute the aggregation locally using
the raw input data, so we can use a debugger.

(Note: the query plan visualizer UI displays the first 20 rows of each stage of the query plan in the preview areas.

## Resolver Replay

Resolver execution can be examined using the Query Plan Visualizer, but Chalk also allows you to directly
execute your resolver on your local computer using the same arguments that were used in your query.

To use the `resolver_replay` functionality:

1. Run an `offline_query` with `store_plan_stages=True` to store the query plan stages, and `recompute_features=True` to allow resolver execution.
2. On the returned dataset, call `resolver_replay` with your resolver function.

Example:

```python
from chalk import ChalkClient

ChalkClient().offline_query(
    input={User.id: [1]},
    output=[User.sum_transactions],
    store_plan_stages=True,
    recompute_features=True
).resolver_replay(sum_transaction_amount)
```

This will execute the resolver locally, using the same input data that was used in the query. This allows you to debug
using your IDE (vscode, pycharm, or even pdb):
