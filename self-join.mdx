Self Joins in Chalk are done via intermediary feature classes.

## Recommended Implementation

To implement a self join, add a new feature class, containing a join to your initial feature class.

<TipInfo>
   You will need to resolve the primary key of the linking feature set. This can be done through a SQL resolver that pulls
  in the Primary key of the feature. For example, for the `has-one` join below, you could create a SQL resolver that resolves `PrequelLink`
  by running a query like: `SELECT id, prequel_id FROM books`.

### Has-one self-join

To specify a `has_one` self-join:
1). Create a new feature class,
2). Link your new feature class back to the original one through a [has-one](/docs/has-one) join.

```python
from typing import Optional
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame, has_one
from chalk import online

@features
class Author:
	id: int
	name: str
	books: "DataFrame[Book]"

@features
class PrequelLink:
    id: int
    prequel_id: int
    book: "Book" = has_one(
        lambda:  Book.id==PrequelLink.prequel_id
    )

@features
class Book:
    id: int
    title: str
    author_id: Author.id
    prequel_id: Optional[PrequelLink.id]
    prequel: PrequelLink | None = has_one(lambda: Book.id==PrequelLink.prequel_id)
```

### Has-many self-join

To create a `has_many` self-join:
1). Create a new feature class,
2). Link your new feature class back to the original one through a [has-many](/docs/has-many) join.

```python
@features
class SeriesLink:
    id: int
    books: "Book" = has_many(lambda: SeriesLink.id == Book.series_id)


@features
class Book:
    id: int
    title: str
    series_id: SeriesLink.id | None
    series: SeriesLink = has_one(lambda: SeriesLink.id == Book.series_id)
```
