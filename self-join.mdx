A self join, involves linking a feature set instance to other feature set instances of the same type. For example, you might want to join a `Book` feature set to its prequel.

Self joins in Chalk are implemented via intermediary feature sets.

## Recommended Implementation

To implement a self join, add a new feature set, which joins back to your initial feature setâ€”this can be either a [has-many](/docs/has-many) or a [has-one](/docs/has-one) join.

<TipInfo>
  In both the cases below you will need to resolve the primary key of the linking feature set. This can be done through a SQL resolver that pulls
  in the primary key of the feature. For example, for the `has-one` join below, you could create a SQL resolver that resolves `PrequelLink`
  by running a query like: `SELECT id, prequel_id FROM books`.
</TipInfo>

### Has-one self join

To specify a `has_one` self join:
1). Create a new feature set,
2). Link your new feature set back to the original one through a [has-one](/docs/has-one) join.

If you were linking a book to its prequel, this might look something like the following:

```python
from typing import Optional
from chalk.features import features, DataFrame, has_one
from chalk import online

@features
class Author:
   id: int
   name: str
   books: "DataFrame[Book]"

@features
class PrequelLink:
    id: int
    prequel_id: int
    book: "Book" = has_one(
        lambda:  Book.id==PrequelLink.prequel_id
    )

@features
class Book:
    id: int
    title: str
    author_id: Author.id
    prequel_id: Optional[PrequelLink.id]
    prequel: PrequelLink | None = has_one(lambda: Book.id==PrequelLink.prequel_id)
```

### Has-many self join

To create a `has_many` self join:
1). Create a new feature set,
2). Link your new feature set back to the original one through a [has-many](/docs/has-many) join.

If you were linking a book to all other books in the same series, this might look something like the following:

<TipInfo>
  Note, in the example below the books linked through the `SeriesLink` would include the source `Book`: for example,
  if books with ids `{1, 2, 3}` are part of the same series and you query for the book with id `1`
  (`chalk query --input book.id=1 --output book.series`) then all three books would be returned: `{1, 2, 3}`.
</TipInfo>

```python
@features
class SeriesLink:
    id: int
    books: "Book" = has_many(lambda: SeriesLink.id == Book.series_id)


@features
class Book:
    id: int
    title: str
    series_id: SeriesLink.id | None
    series: SeriesLink = has_one(lambda: SeriesLink.id == Book.series_id)
```
