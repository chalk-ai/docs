[Windowed features](/docs/aggregations) represent aggregated data pertaining to discrete time buckets.
Using [materialized aggregations](/docs/materialized_aggregations) in concert with streams,
you can update aggregations on the fly as new streaming data arrives.

[Materialized aggregations](/docs/materialized_aggregations) are a powerful tool
to compute aggregations over time windows, combining representations of historical data
with incoming real-time data to produce accurate and fresh results quickly.
If you have a stream resolver that outputs a feature that is related to a feature that uses
a materialized aggregation (more on this later), the materialized aggregations will be updated
as new messages arrive.

## Setting up a materialized aggregation

Setting up features for materialized aggregation with streaming is almost identical to the method described in the
[materialized_aggregations docs](/docs/materialized_aggregations).

```python
from datetime import datetime
from chalk import features, has_many, DataFrame, _
from chalk.streams import Windowed, windowed

@features
class Transaction:
    id: str
    user_id: 'User.id'
    amount: float
    ts: datetime

@features
class User:
    id: str
    name: str
    transactions: DataFrame[Transaction]
    sum_transaction_amount: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d",
        expression=_.transactions[_.amount].sum(),
        materialization=True,
        default=0.0,
    )
    mean_transaction_amount: Windowed[float] = windowed(
        "30d",
        expression=_.transactions[_.amount].mean(),
        materialization=True,
        default=0.0,
    )
```

Now, set up your streaming resolvers referencing these features.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from chalk import features, has_many, DataFrame, Features, _
from chalk.streams import stream, KafkaSource

class TransactionMsg(BaseModel):
    id: str
    user_id: str
    amount: float

@stream(source=KafkaSource(name='...'))
def process_transaction_topic(
    value: TransactionMsg,
) -> Features[Transaction.id, Transaction.user_id, Transaction.amount]:
    return Transaction(
        id=value.id,
        user_id=value.user_id,
        amount=value.amount,
    )
```

That's it! Now, when messages are received on the streams, Chalk will infer whether the output features
of the stream resolver are relevant to materialized aggregations, and if so, will update and store the data
in the existing materialized aggregations.

The resolver `process_transaction_topic` returns `Transaction.id`, `Transaction.user_id`, and `Transaction.amount`.
These features are impact the materialized aggregate features `User.sum_transaction_amount` and
`User.mean_transaction_amount`. Both require two features on transaction:
`Transaction.user_id` (referenced through the join from `_.transactions`) and
`Transaction.amount` (referenced by `_.amount` in the aggregation expression).
When a streaming messages comes through, the resolver `process_transaction_topic` will update
the materialized aggregations with the new values for `User.sum_transaction_amount` and
`User.mean_transaction_amount`.

To opt out of updating materialized aggregations, set `updates_materialized_aggregations=False` on the stream resolver.

## Online Storage

Similar to [materialized aggregations](/docs/materialized_aggregations) that are backfilled from a non-streaming
data source, when the Chalk streaming server receives a message on a stream, if the streaming resolver is used
to compute a materialized aggregation, then the relevant data will be used to update the correct bucket for the
materialized aggregation. When a stream resolver is used to compute a materialized aggregation, the minimum amount of
data required to compute the aggregation will be stored for each bucket. For example, for a sum aggregation, the
sum of all values in the bucket will be stored. Then when new messages arrive, the appropriate bucket based on the
timestamp of the message will be updated with the new value. Because this data is stored online, you can access the
values through both online and offline queries.
