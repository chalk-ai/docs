You can provide Chalk with an [AWS Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) to use AWS-specific integrations (like [Redshift](/docs/redshift)) and [S3 Cloud Storage](/docs/s3).

In your settings page, you'll find a form for adding your credentials:

<AwsIntegration onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} />

You are encouraged to use different access keys for different environments, although they can be shared.

## Creating an access key

Access keys are created directly in the [AWS console, via the AWS CLI, or via the AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey). Make sure that the IAM user you create the access key for has access to the appropriate IAM permissions for your intended integration use case.
