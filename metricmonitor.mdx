Chalk's online dashboard provides a simple way to view
metrics about performance of your [queries](/docs/query-basics) [resolvers](/docs/resolver-overview).
By default, the resolver and query detail pages show request count and latency for each 30 minute interval over the last 2 days, but you may wish to customize this to make it more useful.

---

## Resolver Details

In addition to the default charts, the resolver details page tells you the input and output features of the resolver, plus the implementation code of the resolver.

## Query Details

The query details page shows you much of the same information as the resolver details page, including the input and output features. You can also see which resolvers executed on the right hand sidebar.

## Customize Your Metrics Dashboard

Customize your monitoring view with additional charts, combine metrics into complex formulas, and configure alerting thresholds.
Clicking "Add Metric" brings up the metric editor which you can use to add a new chart to your page.
Edit or remove a chart using the ellipsis menu.

### Add Series


By default, when you click add metric the editor is pre-populated with a new series called Request Count.
Use the drop down fields to change the metric kind, window, grouping function, and conditions. Add additional series to the chart by clicking "Add Series" below.

### Add Formula


Aggregate multiple series together into one chart using a formula. Chalk supports aggregating by `sum`, `total ratio`, `ratio`, `product`, and `abs`

### Add Alert Trigger

Alerts can be triggered on any series or formula. To set up an alert, you should first configure at least one of
a [Pagerduty integration](/docs/pagerduty) or a [Slack integration](/docs/slack). Then you can set up
[Alert Configurations](/docs/alertconfig) to define which channels to use to alert different users or teams.
Then, in your metrics chart, you can select the series, the threshold logic, and the severity, and route the
alert appropriately with the alert owner dropdown. You can select from users in the Chalk environment or free type
an owner name corresponding to one of your alert configurations.
