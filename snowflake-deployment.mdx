Chalk's feature platform enables
machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models
that make their business stand out. Chalk provides a feature store so that
you can deploy production machine learning pipelines for real time data
in minutes.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy their feature and data pipeline definitions
to Chalk’s platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs &
administers its platform on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed
infrastructure then executes the customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

## Database Setup

To use Snowflake as your offline store, we require
a warehouse, a database, a schema within that database, and a user with a role that
has `OWNER` on that database. To provision all of these, you can run the following
commands in a Snowflake worksheet or console. To generate your SSH key pair you can run
the following:

```bash
# Generate the key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f snowflake_key

# Get the public key in the right format (remove header/footer and newlines)
grep -v "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" snowflake_key.pub | grep -v "END PUBLIC KEY" | tr -d '\n'
```

Then, in SnowSQL, run the following commands, replacing the variables at the top:

```sql
-- input variables (feel free to change these)
SET WAREHOUSE_NAME='CHALK_WAREHOUSE';
SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE='XSMALL';
SET ROLE_NAME='CHALK_ROLE';
SET USER_NAME='CHALK_USER';
SET DB_NAME='CHALK';
SET SCHEMA_NAME='OFFLINE_STORE';

-- Create the database + schema + warehouse
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME);
USE DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME);
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($SCHEMA_NAME);
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE=$WAREHOUSE_SIZE;

-- Create a role for Chalk
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME) TO ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) TO ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Create a user for Chalk
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($USER_NAME)
    RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=`<your-public-key-here-without-BEGIN/END-lines>`
    DEFAULT_ROLE=IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME)
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE=IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME)
    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=IDENTIFIER(concat($DB_NAME, '.', $SCHEMA_NAME));

-- derived variables
SET QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME=concat($DB_NAME, '.', $SCHEMA_NAME);

-- Allow Chalk to create storage integrations for bulk loads from cloud object storage
GRANT CREATE INTEGRATION ON ACCOUNT TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Allow Chalk to create internal/external stages for bulk loading
GRANT CREATE STAGE ON SCHEMA IDENTIFIER($QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Grant Chalk owner on the db/schema and usage on the warehouse
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON SCHEMA IDENTIFIER($QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME) REVOKE CURRENT GRANTS;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Grant the Chalk role to the Chalk user
GRANT ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME) TO USER IDENTIFIER($USER_NAME);
```

Please share:

- The `USER_NAME` and RSA private key with us securely via an encrypted message following [using GPG](/docs/public-key).
- The `WAREHOUSE_NAME`, `DB_NAME`, `SCHEMA_NAME`, and `ROLE_NAME` so that we can configure the Chalk platform to use them.
- Your Snowflake account name (`select current_account_name();`) and organization name (`select current_organization_name();`).

## Storage Integration Setup

Once you have created the warehouse, database, schema, user, and role, the next step
is to create storage integration(s).

The storage integration will create an IAM entity
along with allowed or blocked storage locations that will allow Chalk to securely load
and unload data from the offline store.

*Please ask us for a confirmation of which commands to run and the s3 bucket name before
creating the storage integrations,* but it should look something like this:

```sql
CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-dataset-bucket"
TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
STORAGE_PROVIDER='s3'
STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::<your aws account id>:role/snowflake-chalk-{organization}-dataset-bucket'
ENABLED = true
STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://chalk-{organization}-dataset-bucket/');

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-dataset-bucket" TO ROLE "CHALK_ROLE";

DESCRIBE INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-dataset-bucket";
```

Once you have created the storage integration, please send us the `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN`,
`STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN`, and `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`.
