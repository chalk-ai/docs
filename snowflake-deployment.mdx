Chalk's feature platform enables
machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models
that make their business stand out. Chalk provides a feature store so that
you can deploy production machine learning pipelines for real time data
in minutes.

Chalk is both a framework and a platform — developers can write code
using familiar Python packages, and deploy their feature and data pipeline definitions
to Chalk’s platform. In the Customer Cloud deployment, Chalk runs &
administers its platform on the customer’s cloud account. Chalk's managed
infrastructure then executes the customer defined pipelines to compute
[feature](/docs/features)
data for machine learning applications. Chalk then serves this data
back to customer applications for online inference and to customer
data teams for training set generation.

## Database Setup

To use Snowflake as your offline store, we require
a warehouse, a database, a schema within that database, and a user with a role that
has `OWNER` on that database. To provision all of these, you can run the following
commands in a Snowflake worksheet or console. 

Please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#generate-the-private-keys) 
to generate your private and public keys for key-pair authentication in Snowflake. 
Once you have generated your public and private keys, you can continue. 

Then, in SnowSQL, run the following commands, replacing the variables at the top:

```sql
-- input variables (feel free to change these)
SET WAREHOUSE_NAME='CHALK_WAREHOUSE';
SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE='XSMALL';
SET ROLE_NAME='CHALK_ROLE';
SET USER_NAME='CHALK_USER';
SET DB_NAME='CHALK';
SET SCHEMA_NAME='OFFLINE_STORE';

-- Create the database + schema + warehouse
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME);
USE DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME);
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($SCHEMA_NAME);
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE=$WAREHOUSE_SIZE;

-- Create a role for Chalk
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME) TO ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) TO ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Create a user for Chalk
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER($USER_NAME)
    RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=`<your-public-key-here-without-BEGIN/END-lines>`
    DEFAULT_ROLE=IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME)
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE=IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME)
    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=IDENTIFIER(concat($DB_NAME, '.', $SCHEMA_NAME));

-- derived variables
SET QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME=concat($DB_NAME, '.', $SCHEMA_NAME);

-- Allow Chalk to create storage integrations for bulk loads from cloud object storage
GRANT CREATE INTEGRATION ON ACCOUNT TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Allow Chalk to create internal/external stages for bulk loading
GRANT CREATE STAGE ON SCHEMA IDENTIFIER($QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Grant Chalk owner on the db/schema and usage on the warehouse
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON SCHEMA IDENTIFIER($QUALIFIED_SCHEMA_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME) REVOKE CURRENT GRANTS;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE IDENTIFIER($WAREHOUSE_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE IDENTIFIER($DB_NAME) TO IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME);

-- Grant the Chalk role to the Chalk user
GRANT ROLE IDENTIFIER($ROLE_NAME) TO USER IDENTIFIER($USER_NAME);
```

Please share:

- The `USER_NAME` and RSA private key with us securely via an encrypted message following [using GPG](/docs/public-key).
- The `WAREHOUSE_NAME`, `DB_NAME`, `SCHEMA_NAME`, and `ROLE_NAME` so that we can configure the Chalk platform to use them.
- Your Snowflake account name (`select current_account_name();`) and organization name (`select current_organization_name();`).

## Storage Integration Setup

Once you have created the warehouse, database, schema, user, and role, the next step is to create storage integration(s).

The storage integration creates an IAM entity with allowed storage locations, enabling Chalk to securely load and unload data from the offline store.

### Required Information

Before setting up the storage integration, gather the following from your Chalk deployment:

- **AWS Account ID**: The AWS account where your Chalk environment is deployed
- **S3 Bucket Name**: Typically `chalk-{organization}-data-bucket` (confirm with Chalk if different)
- **Snowflake Role Name**: The role name created in the Database Setup step (typically `CHALK_ROLE`)

You'll also need appropriate AWS and Snowflake permissions:
- **AWS**: Permissions to create IAM policies, roles, and update trust relationships
- **Snowflake**: `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or equivalent permissions for `CREATE INTEGRATION`

---

### Step 1: Create AWS IAM Policy

This policy grants Snowflake the minimum permissions needed to read and write objects to your S3 bucket.

Follow the [Snowflake IAM Policy documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#creating-an-iam-policy) to create a policy named `chalk-{organization}-offline-store-access-policy` that allows S3 object operations and bucket listing for your Chalk bucket.

---

### Step 2: Create AWS IAM Role

This role will be assumed by Snowflake to access the S3 bucket.

Follow the [Snowflake IAM Role documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#step-2-create-the-iam-role-in-aws) to create a role named `chalk-{organization}-offline-store-access-role`.

**Important**: When setting the trust policy, use a temporary placeholder with your AWS account ID and external ID `"0000"`. You will update this with actual Snowflake credentials in Step 4.

Attach the IAM policy created in Step 1 to this role.

---

### Step 3: Create Snowflake Storage Integration

This creates the storage integration object in Snowflake that links to the AWS role and S3 bucket.

Follow the [Snowflake Storage Integration Setup documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#step-3-create-a-cloud-storage-integration-in-snowflake) and execute the following SQL commands (replace placeholders with actual values):

```sql
-- Create the storage integration pointing to your AWS S3 bucket and IAM role
CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-data-bucket"
TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
STORAGE_PROVIDER='s3'
STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::<your-aws-account-id>:role/chalk-{organization}-offline-store-access-role'
ENABLED = true
STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://chalk-{organization}-data-bucket/');

-- Grant usage permissions to the Chalk role
GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-data-bucket" TO ROLE "CHALK_ROLE";

-- Verify the integration was created successfully and retrieve Snowflake credentials
DESCRIBE INTEGRATION "s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-data-bucket";
```

From the `DESCRIBE INTEGRATION` output, record the following values:
   - `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN`
   - `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`

You will need these values for Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Update IAM Role Trust Policy

This step completes the trust relationship between Snowflake and AWS by updating the IAM role's trust policy with the actual Snowflake credentials from Step 3.

Follow the [Snowflake trust policy documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#step-5-grant-the-iam-user-permissions-to-access-bucket-objects) to update the trust policy for the role `chalk-{organization}-offline-store-access-role`.

Replace the placeholder values with the actual values from Step 3's `DESCRIBE INTEGRATION` output:
- Replace the Principal's AWS ARN with `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN`
- Replace the External ID with `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`

**Critical**: Ensure you complete this step with the actual Snowflake credentials, not the placeholders. Snowflake cannot access the S3 bucket until this trust policy is properly configured.

---

### Next Steps

After completing this setup:

1. Share the following values with Chalk:
   - Storage Integration Name (e.g., `s3-integration-chalk-{organization}-data-bucket`)
   - `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN`
   - `STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN`
   - `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`
   - AWS Account ID
   - S3 Bucket Name

Chalk will use these values to configure your offline store in the platform.
