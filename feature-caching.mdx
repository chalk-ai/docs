title: Caching
description: Set max staleness to introduce caching.

When a feature is expensive or slow to compute, you may wish to cache its value.
Chalk uses the terminology "maximum staleness" to describe how recently a feature
value needs to have been computed to be returned without re-running a resolver.

You can specify the maximum staleness for a feature as follows:

```py
from chalk.features import feature, features
from datetime import timedelta

@features
class User:
    # Using text descriptors:
    expensive_fraud_score: float = feature(
        max_staleness="**1m 30s**"
    )

    # Alternatively, using timedelta:
    expensive_fraud_score: float = feature(
        max_staleness=timedelta(minutes=1, seconds=30)
    )
```

Max staleness durations can be given in
[natural language](/docs/duration),
or specified using
[datetime.timedelta](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects).
You can specify a max staleness of "infinity" to indicate that Chalk should cache computed feature
values forever. This makes sense for data that never becomes invalid, or for data that you wish
to explicitly update using [Streaming Updates](/docs/streams) or [Reverse ETL](/docs/reverse-etl).

Staleness can also be assigned to all features in a namespace:

```py
@features(max_staleness="**1d**")
class User:
    fraud_score: float
    full_name: str
    email: str = feature(max_staleness="0s")
    ...
```

Here, `User.fraud_score` and `User.full_name`
assume the max-staleness of `1d`.
However, `User.email`, which specifies max-staleness at the feature level,
assumes the max-staleness of `0s`, forcing it to be recomputed on every request.

## Default values

By default, features are not cached, and instead are recomputed for every online request.
In effect, you can think of `max_staleness` as being `0` except where otherwise specified.

In an offline environment, all feature values are taken from past runs or historical tables,
where `max_staleness` does not apply.

## Overriding default caching

The `max_staleness` values provided to the `feature` function
may be overridden at the time of querying for features.
See [Overriding Default Caching](/docs/query-caching) for a detailed discussion.
